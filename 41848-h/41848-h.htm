<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The formation of a Battalion of Jews for service in
the British Army is an event without precedent in our
annals, and the part played by such a unique unit is
assured of a niche in history owing to the fact that it
fought in Palestine, not only for the British cause, but
also for the Restoration of the Jewish people to the
Promised Land.</p>

<p>In writing the following narrative, my object has
been to give a faithful account of the doings of this
Jewish Battalion while it was under my command.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to Captain H. Davis, the Rev.
L. A. Falk, Mr. Bendov of Jerusalem, and Canon
Parfit for permission to reproduce the photographs
illustrating this book, which add considerably to its
interest.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the darkest days of the War, the British
Cabinet decided that it would be good policy
to create a Jewish Regiment, and accordingly, in
August, 1917, the first Jewish Battalion was formed.</p>

<p>From that day forth, as a matter of duty and loyalty
to King and Country, it was clearly incumbent on all
those in authority to treat this new unit with justice,
and do everything in their power to make it a success.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that this Jewish Battalion&mdash;this
ewe lamb of Israel&mdash;did not receive, while on Active
Service in the Holy Land, that measure of justice and
fair play that was its due.</p>

<p>In common with the vast majority of my countrymen
I have the "fair play" sense strongly developed. I
am always prone to be on the side of the under dog&mdash;more
especially when I see that the poor devil is getting
more kicks than in all fairness are his due. In Palestine,
unfortunately, I was constantly called upon to
ward off unfair blows aimed at the Jewish Battalion
under my command by certain members of the local staff
of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>I have passed over many of our sufferings in silence,
and no record of them will be found in this book, but
I am afraid they have left an indelible mark in the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
and heart of every man who served in the Jewish Battalion
under my command, and I fear that the evil
effects of the local Military Administration will
reverberate throughout Palestine for many a long year.</p>

<p>But before I proceed further, let me first of all make
it clearly understood that I am not a Jew,&mdash;indeed, at
the outbreak of the Great War I knew nothing of this
ancient people, always excepting what I had read about
them in the Bible, and other Jewish books. My first
contact with Jews was in the Gallipoli campaign, where
I was sent in command of a Corps composed of Zionists
who had escaped from Palestine at the outbreak of
war and taken service with the British Forces. Presumably
because I had had this experience, I was
appointed to the command of the first Jewish Infantry
unit raised for service with the British Army. The
career of such a unique unit is bound to be closely
followed by all Jews, while it would not surprise me if
the historian of the future seizes upon this dramatic
appearance of the Jewish warrior, fighting for the redemption
of Israel under the banner of England, as
one of the most interesting episodes of the great World
War.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, with a few honourable exceptions,
the local Staff of the E.E.F. were "troublers of
Israel." Instead of furthering the policy of the Home
Government by holding out a helping hand to this
new unit, on the contrary every obstacle was placed
in its way.</p>

<p>In our times of tribulation in the Holy Land, my
thoughts often went back to the Dardanelles, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
heartened and cheered by the remembrance of the
vastly different treatment meted out to the Jewish
soldiers by the Staff in Gallipoli. Sir Ian Hamilton
had vision enough to foresee what a tremendous force
would be won over to the cause of England by dealing
justly with Israel. In the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force the attitude was essentially British. I
regret I cannot say the same of the Staff of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force in 1918 and 1919.</p>

<p>I am happy to be able to put on record that the Battalion
was treated fairly and justly all the time it was
stationed in England. The Staff at Plymouth always
held out a helping hand when needed, and we
embarked for Egypt with the blessing of the War
Office, and of the Adjutant-General, Sir Nevil Macready,
who told us before we sailed that it was his aim
to form a Jewish Brigade, and that he was writing to
the Commander-in-Chief of the E.E.F. to recommend
that this should be done as soon as our numbers justified
such a step.</p>

<p>I felt that the Adjutant-General had confided a great
trust to me when I was selected for the command of this
Jewish unit. It was a complete change from the command
of an Irish Battalion, but the Irishman and the
Jew have much in common&mdash;temperament, generosity,
love of children, devotion to parents, readiness to help
those down on their luck, and, be it noted, great personal
bravery. These qualities will probably not
appear out of place to my readers so far as the Irishman
is concerned, but I imagine many will be surprised
when they hear that they also apply to the Jew. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
true, however, and so should be more widely known.
The soul-stirring deeds on the battlefield of such heroes
as Judas Maccabæus, Bar Kochba, and many others can
never be forgotten.</p>

<p>I had one fear when I took over command of the
Judæans, and that was that I might not be able to do
them justice. I felt that, if a suitable Jewish officer
could be found, it would be more appropriate that he
should have the honour of leading these soldiers
of Israel in the struggle for the redemption of Palestine;
but, although I publicly stated that I should be glad to
see a Jewish officer appointed to the command, no one
came forward, and I was left with the whole weight
of this great responsibility to the Jewish people on my
shoulders. I therefore made up my mind, from the
moment I took command, that, so far as was humanly
possible, the Jewish Battalion should be brought
through its fiery ordeal with honour.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for the new Regiment, and doubly
unfortunate for the Jewish people in Palestine, as this
narrative will show, that the attitude of the local Staff
was diametrically opposed to the declared policy of His
Majesty's Government, which had announced to the
world, in the famous Balfour Declaration, that Palestine
should once again become a National Home for the
Jewish people. In the face of this British announcement,
certain officials in the Holy Land acted as if this
epoch-making Declaration were nothing but a mere
"scrap of paper."</p>

<p>When I observed the vain strivings of these men,
and remembered the Promise to Israel, I called to mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the saying of Gamaliel, the great Rabbi, "If this work
be of men it will come to naught, but if it be of God,
ye cannot overthrow it."</p>

<p>This local anti-Jewish policy eventually culminated
in the Jerusalem pogrom, described at the close of this
book, when, under British rule, murderous native mobs
ran riot, practically unchecked, for nearly three days
within the walls of the City.</p>

<p>This deplorable outrage at last opened the eyes of the
Imperial Authorities to what was going on in Palestine,
with the result that the Military Administration was
abolished. A competent civil Governor replaced the
Military Administrator, and Sir Herbert Samuel was
sent out to pour oil and wine into the wounds which the
unfortunate Jewish inhabitants had received, and to
carry out the declared policy of England as announced
in the Balfour Declaration.</p>

PALESTINE CAMPAIGN</b></big></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Balfour Declaration.</span></div>


<p>In the early days of 1917 the outlook for the Allied
Powers was particularly black and menacing.
England, the mainstay in the great struggle, was in
deadly peril, for, just about this time, the ruthless Submarine
campaign was at its height and our shipping losses
were appalling.</p>

<p>The Central Powers, with startling rapidity, had
crushed and overrun Belgium, Serbia, and Roumania,
and a large slice of France was in the grip of the invader.
It was a case of stalemate with Italy, while Russia, the
Colossus with the feet of clay, was in the throes of a
Revolution and lost to the Allies.</p>

<p>Turkey, the so-called "sick man of Europe," was
found not only able to "sit up and take nourishment,"
but strong enough to administer some nasty knocks to
the surgeon, as we discovered to our cost in Gallipoli,
and other places in the Near East.</p>

<p>The Great Republic of the West did indeed throw
in her lot with us in April, 1917, but many perilous
months would have to elapse before she could pull her
full weight, or even make her enormous power felt to
any appreciable extent on the battlefields of Europe.</p>

<p>At such a moment as this it was of the very greatest
importance that the world should be carefully scanned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and every available ideal and policy made use of, which
could be of advantage to our righteous cause.</p>

<p>The happy inspiration thereupon seized upon our
Ministers to win over to the side of the Allies the teeming
millions of the Children of Israel scattered throughout
the world.</p>

<p>The restoration of these people to the land of their
forefathers had long been engaging the thoughts of mankind,
and our Statesmen now felt that the time was ripe
for this age-long issue to be brought to fruition.</p>

<p>It was of course known to the leading Zionists that
the British Government was considering the policy of
making a pronouncement in favour of the Jewish
people, and many of the leaders of Zionism, such as
Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Sokolow, Mr. Jabotinsky, Mr.
Joseph Cowen, etc., lost no opportunity of pressing
home the importance of winning Jewry, the world over,
to England's side, by declaring boldly for a Jewish
Palestine.</p>

<p>It was felt by many that the right and proper way
for Jewry to help England was by raising a Jewish
Legion to aid in the redemption of Palestine, and of
this movement the leading spirit was Vladimir Jabotinsky,
a distinguished orator, author, and journalist.</p>

<p>Ever since the beginning of the War this remarkable
man, a Jew from Russia, had carried on a vigorous
propaganda on behalf of England. At his own expense,
he had founded a newspaper in Copenhagen,
and distributed it broadcast among Jews in Russia,
Poland, neutral countries, America, etc.</p>

<p>His propaganda was of great value to the Allies, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the Jews naturally hated Russia, owing to their harsh
treatment and persecution in that country, and it was not
until Jabotinsky set to work that they perceived that
their real interests lay with the Allies.</p>

<p>To show a good example to others, he enlisted as a
private in the 20th Battalion London Regiment, where
he gathered round him a platoon composed principally
of men who had recently been serving in Gallipoli in
the Zion Mule Corps.</p>

<p>From his humble position in the ranks he bombarded
the Prime Minister, and the Secretaries of State for
War and Foreign Affairs in this country; he sent emissaries
to America, North and South, to Russia, Poland,
the Caucasus, etc., and when, in July, 1917, the Government
declared their intention of creating a Jewish
Regiment, he had everything in train for the formation
of a legion at least 50,000 strong.</p>

<p>I mention this here as one instance of this gallant
officer's efforts for England, and I will ask the reader to
make a mental note of it, for before this narrative is
ended it will be my painful duty to show how Jabotinsky
was rewarded for all his invaluable services to the British
cause.</p>

<p>The Government policy towards world Jewry was
brought to a head by a vigorous Zionist offensive, and
resulted in the creation of a Jewish Battalion in August,
1917, followed a little later by the famous Balfour Declaration
in favour of a National Home for the Jewish
people in Palestine.</p>

<p>This bold and wise pronouncement of British policy
was of great and far-reaching importance, and is regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by Jewry throughout the world as their Charter
of Liberty.</p>

<p>It is embodied in the following letter to Lord
Rothschild:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Foreign Office</span>,<br />
2nd November, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lord Rothschild</span>,</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in conveying to you on
behalf of H.M.'s Government, the following
Declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations,
which has been submitted to and
approved by the Cabinet:</p>

<p><b>His Majesty's Government view with
favour the establishment in Palestine of a
National Home for the Jewish people,
and will use their best endeavours to
facilitate the achievement of this object</b>,
it being clearly understood that nothing shall be
done which may prejudice the civil and religious
rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,
or the rights and political status enjoyed by
Jews in any other country.</p>

<p>I should be grateful if you would bring this
Declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist
Federation.</p>

<div class="right">
Yours sincerely,<br />
(Signed) <span class="smcap">Arthur James Balfour</span>.<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>This was, perhaps, the most momentous Declaration
made throughout the War, and it derived a special significance
from the fact that it was made just at the time
when the first definite steps were being taken towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
freeing Palestine from the yoke of the Turk. It was
received by practically all sections of the British Press
with the most cordial approval.</p>

<p>By pious Jews it was regarded as little short of the
Voice of God, bringing their long-cherished aspirations
within sight of fulfilment.</p>

<p>All down the centuries from the time of the Dispersion
it has been the dream of the Jew that one day he
would be restored to his ancestral home. In his exile
the age-long cry of his stricken soul has ever been
"next year in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Christians too have always believed in the fulfilment
of prophecy, and the Restoration of the Jewish people
is of no little interest to them, so it can be imagined with
what feelings of joy and gratitude the masses of the
Jewish people looked upon this promise of England,
holding out as it did the prospect of the realization of
their dearest hope. Nothing like it has been known
since the days of King Cyrus. It is not too much to
say that this epoch-making Declaration uplifted the soul
of Israel the world over.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Balfour may not live to see the full fruits of
his famous pronouncement, but prophecy will assuredly
be fulfilled, and his name will go down for all time,
second only to that of Cyrus, in the Chronicles of Israel.</p>

<p>Jeremiah's prophecy on the Restoration of Israel has
a wonderful significance in these days: "Hear the
word of the Lord, <i>O ye nations, and declare it in the
isles afar off</i>, and say, He that scattered Israel <i>will
gather him and keep him</i>, as a Shepherd doth his
flock."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sanballats.</span></div>


<p>On the 27th July, 1917, while I was stationed at
the Curragh in command of a Battalion of the
Royal Dublin Fusiliers, I got a telegram from the War
Office ordering me to report there and commence the
organization of the Jewish Legion about to be raised,
so I set out forthwith for London.</p>

<p>On getting my instructions from Major-General R.
Hutchison, the Director of Organization, he told me,
among other things, that a certain Sergeant Jabotinsky
would probably be most useful to me, for he was a very
keen worker and an ardent advocate of the Jewish
Regiment. I told him that I had already met Jabotinsky,
and I knew his assistance would be invaluable, and
requested that he might be attached to me for duty at
once.</p>

<p>I was given a room at the War Office Annexe which
had been taken over from the National Liberal Club.
Here I was joined in due course by Jabotinsky, now a
full-fledged sergeant.</p>

<p>We had hardly begun to move in the matter of recruiting
for the Jewish Regiment, when I became aware
that in certain quarters of influential English Jewry there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was violent hostility to Zionist aspirations, and also to
the very idea of a Jewish Regiment.</p>

<p>I therefore felt that, in order to clear the air, it would
be necessary to hold a meeting of those who were in
favour of, as well as those who were opposed to, the
formation of a Jewish Regiment, and try to induce the
latter to cease obstructing a policy which had already
been decided upon by the British Government, and to
give me their help in making the proposed Regiment a
success.</p>

<p>A meeting of representative men on both sides was
held at the War Office on the 8th August, 1917. Among
those present were: Lord Rothschild, Major Lionel de
Rothschild, Major Neil Primrose, Captain Ormsby
Gore, M.P., Mr. Sebag Montefiore, Dr. Weizmann,
Mr. Joseph Cowen, Dr. Eder, Captain Salaman,
R.A.M.C., Mr. M. J. Landa, Mr. L. J. Greenberg,
the Rev. S. Lipson (Senior Jewish Chaplain to the
Forces in England), and Sergeant Jabotinsky&mdash;about
twenty in all. Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, M.P. (whose
untimely death I deeply lament), and Lieut.-Colonel
L. S. Amery, M.P., who were then Secretaries to the
War Cabinet, also attended, both being warm friends of
the movement.</p>

<p>I briefly addressed the meeting and explained that I
had called them together to give me their advice and
assistance in the formation of the Jewish Regiment.</p>

<p>I was, of course, aware that there was somewhat of a
cleavage amongst the Jews on this question, but the
bitterness and hostility shown was quite a revelation to
me. I could not understand how any Jew could fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
grasp this Heaven-sent opportunity and do all in his
power to further the efforts of the British Government
on behalf of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, therefore, when certain of the
Jews in opposition vigorously denounced the formation
of a Jewish Regiment, and equally vigorously damned
the aspirations of the Zionists!</p>

<p>Dr. Weizmann gave a slashing reply to the Sanballats
from the Zionist point of view which cut the ground
from under their feet; and Jabotinsky, in his address for
the cause he had at heart, lifted the debate to a level
immeasurably above the point of view of his opponents.</p>

<p>A few others spoke, and then I again addressed the
meeting and said I thought it was a good thing the
Government had not left it to the community to form a
Jewish Regiment, for I saw that they would never agree;
but, as the Government had already made up its mind,
and was determined to have a Jewish Legion of some
kind, I begged them to lay aside all differences and help
me to make a success of a movement which was bound
to affect Jews, one way or another, throughout the
world. In conclusion, I said I would rather know who
were my friends, and asked all those who did not intend
to further this scheme, which after all was a scheme propounded
and adopted by the British Government, to
retire. Not a man moved.</p>

<p>While I was making my address a note was passed
to me from hand to hand. On opening it I read, "Can
you dine with me this evening? I should like to join
your new Battalion. N.P." I little knew when I
scribbled back: "So sorry, am engaged," what serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
consequences hung on my answer, for I feel sure that
Neil Primrose would not have been cut off in his prime
had I dined with him that night and "recruited" him
for the Jewish Battalion, but I never saw this very gallant
officer again. He went out to Palestine soon afterwards,
where he met his death while leading his men in a charge.</p>

<p>To return to the meeting: when I found that not
one of our opponents was prepared to declare himself
an open enemy of the policy of H.M.'s Government, I
said that as the formation of the various Committees connected
with the Regiment was an essentially Jewish
matter I would now retire, and I asked Lord Rothschild
to take the Chair.</p>

<p>Within half an hour I was summoned by Brigadier-General
Sir Auckland Geddes, as he then was. The
General appeared to be extremely flurried and annoyed.
Apparently, immediately after I had left the meeting,
two gentlemen had gone straight from it to Sir Auckland,
and made a bitter attack on me for having, as they said,
held a Zionist Meeting in the War Office.</p>

<p>I assured him that there was no attempt at holding a
Zionist meeting, but that a number of representative
Jews and others had been called to help me in carrying
out the policy of the War Office, and I pointed out that
it was entirely due to the two gentlemen who complained,
that any question of Zionism had been raised.</p>

<p>Why any Jew should be an anti-Zionist passes my
comprehension, for the Zionist ideal in no way interferes
with the rights and privileges of those fortunate Jews
who have found happy homes in friendly countries, but
aims at establishing a national home for those less happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ones, who, against their will, are forced to live in exile,
and who have never ceased to yearn for the land promised
to their forefather Abraham and his seed for ever.</p>

<p>Yet I will have to show that, as there were Sanballats<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
who bitterly opposed the restoration in the days
of King Artaxerxes 2,500 years ago, so there were
modern Sanballats who bitterly opposed the restoration
in the days of King George.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Formation of the Jewish Regiment.</span></div>


<p>On the 23rd August, 1917, the formation of the
"Jewish Regiment" was officially announced
in the <i>London Gazette</i>, and I was appointed to the command
of a Battalion.</p>

<p>At the same time it was officially intimated that a
special Jewish name and badge would be given to the
Battalions of this Regiment.</p>

<p>On hearing of this determination the Sanballats immediately
got very busy. Heads were put together,
and letters written up and down the land to all and
sundry who were likely to serve their purpose, with the
result that, on the 30th August, 1917, a deputation
waited upon Lord Derby (then Secretary of State for
War), for the purpose of making representations
against the proposed name and badge of the Jewish
Regiment, and, in fact, against the formation of any
such unit as a Jewish Battalion.</p>

<p>One member of this Deputation went so far as to
represent to Lord Derby that Lord Rothschild, the head
of the celebrated Jewish family, to whom, as representing
the Jewish people, Mr. Balfour later on addressed the
famous declaration, was also opposed to the formation
of a Jewish Regiment.</p>

<p>Lord Rothschild assured me that this was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
case; for, once it became the policy of the British
Government to form a Jewish Regiment, he felt bound
as a patriotic Jew to back it up and do all in his power to
make it a success. No little thanks are due to Lord
Rothschild for the way he devoted himself to the comfort
and welfare of the Jewish Battalions, from the first day
they were formed.</p>

<p>The result of the Deputation was that the name
"Jewish Regiment" was abolished, and no Jewish
badge was sanctioned. All Jewish Battalions raised
were to be called "Royal Fusiliers."</p>

<p>But our worthy friends might have saved themselves
all the trouble they took, and the trouble they gave to
the War Ministry, because, from the moment that the
battalions were formed, although they were known
officially as Royal Fusiliers, yet unofficially, everywhere,
and by every person, they were known solely as the
Jewish Battalions.</p>

<p>Lord Derby made the mistake of thinking that these
few rich men represented the Jewish masses. A greater
mistake was never made, for, from my own experience,
I can vouch for the fact that they are altogether out of
touch with the thoughts and feelings of the vast majority
of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>What a different tale I should have to tell had men
such as these played up to the policy of England. Had
their vision only been broader, they would have said
among themselves, "This is a policy we do not like.
It may affect us adversely, but it is the policy of
England, and England in peril, and we must therefore
bind ourselves together and make it a success."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>If they feared that these Jews from Russia and Poland
would not worthily uphold Jewish traditions, they might
have gone to the Secretary for War and told him their
fears, and said that, as it was absolutely necessary for
world Jewry that this experiment of creating Jewish
Battalions should have a fair chance, they would request
his aid in this matter, and ask that at least twenty-five
per cent. of every battalion be composed of Jews from
England, who, having seen service in France, would
therefore give some necessary and valuable stiffening to
these raw Jewish units.</p>

<p>With such a stiffening, and a solid English Jewry at
the back of the Jewish Regiment, what a triumphant
page in Jewish history these battalions would have
written!</p>

<p>Instead of this, every possible obstacle was placed in
the way of success. Interested parties scoured the East
end of London and the big provincial cities, advising
young Jews not to enlist. Even in France the Jewish
soldiers serving in the various units there were told by
Jews who ought to have known better that they should
on no account transfer. The result of this was that
recruiting went on very slowly, and instead of being able
to form a Jewish legion in the course of a few weeks, as
could easily have been done out of the 40,000 Jewish
young men in England alone, it took over four months
to form even one battalion.</p>

<p>I happened by chance one day to meet a prominent
member of the Sanballat deputation in the War Office,
and, in the course of conversation, I asked him why he
objected so strongly to the formation of a Jewish Regiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He replied that he had no faith in the Russian
Jews, and feared they would bring discredit on Jewry.
I said that, from what I had seen in Gallipoli of the Jew
from Russia, I had more faith in him than he had, and
that I felt confident I could make him into a good soldier.
He was kind enough to remark, "Well, perhaps under
you they will turn out to be good soldiers, but then they
might win Palestine, and <i>I</i> don't want to be sent there
to live." I replied that his fears in this respect were
entirely groundless. He remarked that he was not so
sure about that, for if the Jews had a country of their
own, pressure might be brought to bear upon them to
go and live there&mdash;which clearly shows that these rich
and fortunate Jews cannot have given much real thought
to the question, for there is nothing in the Zionist movement
to force anyone to live in Palestine, and it would
be manifestly impossible to pack 14,000,000 of people
within the narrow limits of their ancestral home.</p>

<p>When my pessimistic friend told me that these foreign
Jews were no good, and would bring discredit upon the
best part of Jewry, I made a mental resolve that I would
prove to him one day that his despised Jewish brethren,
from Russia and elsewhere, would make as good soldiers,
and as good all-round men, as those in any unit of the
British Army. As these pages progress, and the history
of the 38th Jewish Battalion is unfolded before the
eyes of the reader, it will be seen that my expectations
were more than realised, for the Battalion drilled,
marched, fought, and generally played the game as
well as any battalion in the Army.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that, so far as I could gather, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Inner Actions Committee of the Zionist organization,
with the honoured exception of Dr. Weizmann, looked
on us with suspicion. The formation of Jewish Battalions
did not appeal to them. How it was possible
that the leaders of Zionism should not have grasped,
and taken to their hearts, this gift of Jewish Battalions
from the British Government, for the furtherance of
their own ends, is one of the greatest examples of ineptitude
that have ever come within my experience.
Here was a body of keen and enthusiastic men, devoting
their lives to the restoration of the Holy Land to its rightful
owners, and yet they shied when the one essential
weapon that could have given it to them was being virtually
thrust into their hands.</p>

<p>How different would have been the position of the
Zionists at the Peace Conference after the Armistice
was signed if they had been able to point proudly to
50,000 Jewish troops in Palestine, instead of to the
5,000 who were actually serving there at the close of the
War.</p>

<p>I know that Dr. Weizmann had vision enough to foresee
the strength which such a legion would give to his
diplomacy, but unfortunately his colleagues on the
Zionist Council did not see eye to eye with him in this
matter until it was too late.</p>

<p>I tried to do what in me lay with certain of the leaders
of Zionism, and spent some time endeavouring to enthuse
a devoted and spiritual Jew who was deeply interested
in the Restoration; indeed, I thought I had won
him over to the cause of the legion, for at times during
our conversation his face lit up at the possibilities unfolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to him, but, alas, after I left him, I fear he fell
away from grace!</p>

<p>Some of the Zionists, men such as Mr. Joseph Cowen,
fully realised all the advantages which would accrue
from a Jewish legion helping to win Palestine from the
enemy, and these were eager workers towards this end.</p>

<p>Vladimir Jabotinsky always believed in the proverb
that the Lord helps those who help themselves, and,
therefore, he felt that it was essential that a Jewish
legion should fight for the redemption of Israel's
ancient heritage. And it was well for Jewry that Jabotinsky
was a chosen instrument, because, if no Jewish
troops had fought in Palestine, and no Jewish graves
could be seen in the Cemetery on the Mount of Olives,
and in every Military Cemetery in Egypt and Palestine,
it would have been, for all time, a reproach unto Israel,
and I have grave doubts whether the Peace Conference
would have considered the time ripe for the Jewish
people to be restored to their ancient land. I am certain
of this, that if Jabotinsky's ideals of a powerful legion
had been more fully realised, Dr. Weizmann's position
at the table of the Peace Conference would have been
immeasurably strengthened.</p>

<p>It must, however, be recorded for the honour of
British Jewry, that the vast majority of English Jews
were heartily in accord with the Government policy, and
proud of the fact that, practically for the first time in
Jewish history since the days of Judas Maccabæus and
Bar Kochba, battalions of Jewish infantry were to be
raised and led against the common enemy in Palestine.</p>

<p>It was also to the credit of English Jewry that a deputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
representing the Jewish masses in England,
sought and obtained an interview with the Secretary of
State for War, with the view to the retention of a distinctive
Jewish name and badge for the Battalions. This
deputation was introduced on Sept. 5th by Mr.
J. D. Kiley, M.P., a non-Jew, and among others the
following men were present:&mdash;Captain Redcliffe Salaman,
Dr. Eder, Messrs. Elkin Adler, Joseph Cowen,
L. J. Greenberg, M. J. Landa, etc. Lord Derby had,
however, committed himself to the first deputation, and
all he could promise to the deputation representing the
Jewish masses was that, if the Regiment distinguished
itself in the Field, it would then be given a Jewish title
and a Jewish badge. This deputation also obtained the
War Secretary's sanction to the supply of Kosher food,
and to the observance of Saturday as the day of rest;
Lord Derby also promised that, as far as possible, all
Jewish festivals should be respected, and that Jewish
units would, service conditions permitting, be employed
only in Palestine.</p>

<p>How the Battalions distinguished themselves, and
won a special Jewish name and badge, will be recorded
faithfully in the following pages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Training at Plymouth.</span></div>


<p>I was delighted when, at last, I got away from
organization duty at the War Office, with all its
worries and vicissitudes, and commenced the real active
work of training a fighting Battalion of Jews.</p>

<p>Plymouth was the spot chosen as our training centre,
and at the Crown Hill Barracks, near this famous and
beautiful harbour, we commenced our military career.</p>

<p>A recruiting Depôt was at the same time established
in London at 22, Chenies Street, where a Staff was installed
under the command of Major Knowles, an excellent
officer, who had previously served under me in the
South African War, and who was an ardent supporter of
Zionist ideals.</p>

<p>Recruits were received here, and fitted out with
uniforms before being sent on to Plymouth. The comfort
of the men while at the Depôt was ably attended to by
various Committees of ladies and gentlemen, whose
names will be found in the Appendix. They were fortunately
in a position to give much needed financial aid
to various dependents from the moment the Committees
began work, for public-spirited and liberal Jews were
found who gave to the good cause with both hands.
Among these was Mr. Leopold Frank, who gave the
princely donation of £1,000. Mr. Lionel D. Walford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
especially was untiring in his efforts for the welfare and
happiness of every recruit who came to the Depôt, and
so won the hearts of all by the personal service that he
gave, day in and day out, that he was universally and
affectionately known to the Judæans as "Daddy."</p>

<p>As a nucleus for the Jewish Battalion I arranged for
the transfer of a platoon of my old Zion Mule Corps men
from the 20th Battalion of the London Regiment, where
they were then serving under the command of Colonel
A. Pownall. My best thanks are due to this officer for
the help he gave me in effecting the transfer of my old
veterans. These warlike sons of Israel, not content
with the laurels they had already won in Gallipoli, sought
for fresh adventure in other fields, and so volunteered
for service in France. On the way their ship was torpedoed
and sunk by an Austrian submarine, but fortunately
not a Zion man was drowned; all managed to
cling on to spars and other wreckage and floated safely
to a Grecian isle from which they were rescued. They
eventually reached England in safety, but all their personal
belongings were lost.</p>

<p>Men soon began to arrive at Plymouth in batches of
twenties and thirties, from all over the Kingdom. Many
trades and professions were represented, but the vast
majority were either tailors or in some way connected
with the tailoring trade. I made it a practice to see
every recruit as soon as he joined and find out something
about his family and affairs. I also gave every
man some advice as to how he was to conduct himself
as a good soldier and a good Jew. The famous sculptor,
Jacob Epstein, was one of my most promising recruits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and after he had served for some months in the ranks
I recommended him for a commission. When the 38th
Battalion left Plymouth for Palestine, Epstein remained
behind with the second Jewish Battalion then formed,
but owing to some bungling the commission was never
granted.</p>

<p>The difficulties of my command were not few.</p>

<p>On broad religious grounds Judaism is not compatible
with a soldier's life&mdash;and I may say I had many
strict Jews in the Battalion; then the men were aliens,
utterly unaccustomed to Army life, and with an inherent
hatred of it, owing to the harsh military treatment to
which the Jew in Russia was subjected; some of them
did not speak English, and practically all of them hated
serving any cause which might in the end help Russia;
they knew also that there was a strong body of Jewish
opinion in England which was hostile to the idea of a
Jewish unit.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the recruits came from
sedentary occupations. They had never been accustomed
to an out-door, open-air life, and naturally
dreaded, and really felt, the strain of the hard military
training which they had to undergo in those cold winter
days in Plymouth.</p>

<p>It can be imagined, therefore, that I had no easy task
before me in moulding these sons of Israel, and inspiring
them with that martial ardour and <i>esprit de corps</i> which
is so necessary, if men are to be of any use on the field
of battle. I impressed upon them that strict discipline,
and hard training, was not merely for my amusement or
benefit, but was entirely in their own interests, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
when the day of battle came they would be fitter men
and better fighters than their enemies, and with these
two points in their favour the chances were that instead
of getting killed, they would kill their opponents and
emerge from the battle triumphant.</p>

<p>The men soon grasped the idea, and took to soldiering
and all that it means with a hearty goodwill. I am
happy to say that all difficulties were surmounted, and,
at the close of the campaign, the Battalion presented as
fine and steady an appearance on Parade as any Battalion
in the E.E.F.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, I had an able and enthusiastic staff to
assist me in my endeavours. I cannot sufficiently
praise the great service rendered to the Battalion, during
its infant stages, by Captain Redcliffe Salaman,
R.A.M.C., who was our medical officer. His knowledge
of the men and of Jewish matters generally was
invaluable to me.</p>

<p>My Adjutant, Captain Neill, had already had two
years' experience in a similar position with a battalion
of the Rifle Brigade. I found him to be able and diplomatic&mdash;the
latter an essential quality in the handling
of Jewish soldiers.</p>

<p>In my Second in Command, Major MacDermot, I
had an officer of wide experience and high principles, who
had served under my command in the Dublin Fusiliers.</p>

<p>In my Assistant Adjutant, Lt. B. Wolffe (whose
tragic death in Palestine I shall relate in its proper
place), I had an exceptionally gifted Jewish officer, hardworking,
painstaking, conscientious, and all out in
every way to make the Jewish Battalion a success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I tried to induce Senior Jewish officers to join the
Battalion, but I found it very hard to get volunteers, for
the Senior men preferred to remain in their own British
Regiments.</p>

<p>I was able to obtain the services of a fair number of
Junior Jewish officers, and the Battalion gradually filled
up in officers, N.C.O.'s and men.</p>

<p>I would like to mention here that, although the great
majority of all ranks were Jews, yet there were some
Christian officers, N.C.O.'s and one or two men. In
spite of this there was never the very slightest question
between us of either race or religion. All eventually
became animated with one spirit&mdash;the success, welfare
and good name of this Jewish Battalion.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that we had practically no crime to
stain our record. There was not a single case of a civil
offence being recorded against us all the time we were
at Plymouth, which is something new in Army annals.</p>

<p>And yet another record was created by this unique
Battalion. The Wet Canteen, where beer only was
sold, had to be closed, for not a single pint was drunk
all the time it was open.</p>

<p>The men showed wonderful quickness and aptitude in
mastering the details of their military training. It came
as a surprise to me to find that a little tailor, snatched
from the purlieus of Petticoat Lane, who had never
in all his life wielded anything more dangerous than a
needle, soon became quite an adept in the use of the
rifle and bayonet, and could transfix a dummy figure of
the Kaiser in the most approved scientific style, while
negotiating a series of obstacle-trenches at the double.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />"I HAD AN ABLE AND ENTHUSIASTIC STAFF"<br />
(<i>See page <a href="#Page_33">33</a></i>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>I noticed that the men were particularly smart in all
that they did whenever a General came along. I
remember on one occasion, when we were about to be
inspected, I told the men to be sure and stand steady
on parade during the General Salute; I impressed upon
them that it was a tradition in the British Army that,
unless a Battalion stood perfectly steady at this critical
moment, it would be thought lacking in discipline and
smartness, and would get a bad report from the General.
So zealous were my men to uphold this time-honoured
tradition, that I verily believe that these wonderful
enthusiasts for rigid British discipline never blinked an
eyelid while the General was taking the salute. Certainly
every Commander who inspected us always
expressed his astonishment at the rock-like steadiness
of the Jewish Battalion on parade.</p>

<p>During our training period at Plymouth we received
many kindnesses from the Jewish community there,
more especially from its President, Mr. Meyer
Fredman.</p>

<p>In the long winter evenings we had lecturers who
addressed the men on various interesting subjects.
The famous and learned Rabbi Kuk of Jerusalem paid
us a visit, and gave the men a stirring address on their
duties as Jewish soldiers. Jabotinsky gave various
lectures, one especially on Bialik, the great Jewish poet,
being particularly memorable.</p>

<p>We had many talented music-hall and theatrical men
in our ranks; our concerts were, therefore, excellent,
and our concert party was in great request throughout
the Plymouth district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>If there was one officer more than another who helped
to promote the men's comfort, it was Lieut. E.
Vandyk. He was in charge of the messing arrangements,
and the Battalion was exceptionally fortunate
in having a man of his experience to undertake this
most exacting of all tasks.</p>

<p>Later on Vandyk proved himself equally capable as
a leader in the field, where he was promoted to the
rank of Captain.</p>

<p>I must not forget the kindness shown to us at
Plymouth by Lady Astor, M.P., who gave us a
Recreation Hut, and by Sir Arthur Yapp, the Secretary
of the Y.M.C.A., who furthered our comfort in every
possible way.</p>

<p>While we were yet at Plymouth I received orders
from the War Office to form two more Jewish Battalions
in addition to the 38th.</p>

<p>As soon as sufficient recruits justified it I recommended
the Authorities to proceed with the formation
of the 39th Battalion and to appoint Major Knowles,
from the Depôt, to the Command. This was done,
and from what I saw during the time I was in Plymouth,
I felt quite confident that Colonel Knowles would make
an excellent commander.</p>

<p>Colonel Knowles was succeeded at the Depôt in
London by Major Schonfield, who worked untiringly
to promote the interests of the recruits, and to imbue
them with a good, soldierly spirit while they were
passing through his hands in Chenies Street. About
the same time as Colonel Knowles was appointed,
Captain Salaman so highly recommended his brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Colonel F. D. Samuel, D.S.O., to me that
I asked the Adjutant-General if this officer might be
recalled from France to take charge of the training at
Plymouth, and Jewish affairs there generally, after my
departure for Palestine. The Adjutant-General very
kindly agreed to my request, and transferred Colonel
Samuel from France to Plymouth at very short notice.</p>

<p>Soon after I left for Palestine recommendations were
made to the War Office that it would be preferable to
have a Jewish officer in command of the 39th Battalion,
and the result was that Colonel Samuel was appointed
to the 39th Battalion in the place of Colonel Knowles.
This treatment was most unfair to the latter, who had
worked extremely hard and enthusiastically, both at
the Depôt and during the time he held command of
the 39th Battalion, where he did all the spade work
and made things very easy for his successor. Colonel
Knowles afterwards went to France and later on served
with the North Russian Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>Of course, it was all to the good to have a Jewish
Commanding Officer, but it should have been arranged
without doing an injustice to Colonel Knowles.</p>

<p>About this time Major Margolin, D.S.O., a Jewish
officer attached to the Australian Forces, was transferred
to the Depôt at Plymouth, and eventually
replaced Colonel Samuel in the command of the 39th
Battalion.</p>

<p>Outsiders will never be able to imagine the immense
amount of trouble and detail involved in the formation
of this unique unit. I must say that the War Office,
and the local command at Plymouth, gave me every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
possible assistance. Colonel King, of the Military
Secretary's Staff at the W.O., helped me through many
a difficulty in getting Jewish officers brought back from
France.</p>

<p>Colonel Graham, also of the War Office, came to my
assistance whenever he could possibly do so, while the
late Military Secretary, General Sir Francis Davies,
under whom I had served in Gallipoli, was kindness
itself.</p>

<p>General Hutchison, the Director of Organization,
was always a tower of strength, and the Jewish Battalions
owe him a heavy debt. Lieut.-Colonel Amery,
M.P., and the late Sir Mark Sykes, M.P., also did
what was in their power to make our thorny path
smooth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Kosher Problem.</span></div>


<p>The only serious trouble we had in Plymouth
occurred over Kosher food. As most people
probably know, Jewish food has to be killed and
cooked in a certain way as laid down in Jewish Law,
and it is then known as "kosher," <i>i.e.</i> proper.</p>

<p>This was, of course, quite new to the Military
authorities, and the Army being a very conservative
machine, and, at times, a very stubborn one, they failed
to see the necessity of providing special food for the
Jewish troops&mdash;a curious state of mentality considering
the care taken with the food of our Moslem soldiers.</p>

<p>I have a fairly shrewd idea that all the blame for the
trouble we were put to in this matter must not rest
altogether on the shoulders of the Army officials, for I
strongly suspect that our Jewish "friends," the enemy,
who were so anxious to destroy the Jewishness of the
Regiment, had their fingers in this Kosher pie!</p>

<p>Now I felt very strongly that unless the Jewish
Battalion was treated as such, and all its wants, both
physical and spiritual, catered for in a truly Jewish way,
this new unit would be an absolute failure, for I could
only hope to appeal to them as Jews, and it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hardly be expected that there would be any response to
this appeal if I countenanced such an outrage on their
religious susceptibilities as forcing them to eat unlawful
food. I made such a point of this that I was at length
summoned to the War Office by the Adjutant-General,
Sir Nevil Macready, who informed me that I was to
carry on as if I had an ordinary British battalion, and
that there was to be no humbug about Kosher food, or
Saturday Sabbaths, or any other such nonsense. I
replied very respectfully, but very firmly, that if this
was to be the attitude taken up by the War Office, it
would be impossible to make the Battalion a success, for
the only way to make good Jewish soldiers of the men
was by first of all treating them as good Jews; if they
were not to be treated as Jews, then I should request
to be relieved of my command.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as I returned to Plymouth, I
forwarded my resignation, but the G.O.C. Southern
Command returned it to me for reconsideration.</p>

<p>In the meantime a telegram was received from the
War Office to say that the Kosher food would be
granted, and Saturday would be kept as the Sabbath.</p>

<p>After this things went smoothly; Sir Nevil Macready
readily lent us his ear when I put up an S.O.S., and,
as a matter of fact, he became one of our staunchest
friends.</p>

<p>I was more than gratified to receive, a few days later,
the following "Kosher" charter from the War Office&mdash;a
charter which helped us enormously all through our
service, not only in England, but also when we got
amongst the Philistines in Palestine.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Before we sailed for the front, General Macready did
us the honour of coming all the way from London,
travelling throughout the night, to pay us a friendly
visit, without any of the pomp or circumstance of war,
and he was so impressed by what he saw of the soldierly
bearing of the men that, from that day until the day
he left office, no reasonable request from the Jewish
Battalion was ever refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>I had a final interview with General Macready at
the W.O. before setting out for Palestine, when he told
me in the presence of Major-General Hutchison,
Director of Organization, that the object he aimed at
was the formation of a complete Jewish Brigade, and
that he was recommending General Allenby to commence
that formation as soon as two complete Jewish
Battalions arrived in Egypt.</p>

<p>Of course, this was very welcome news to me, because
it would mean all the difference in the world to
our welfare and comfort if we formed our own Brigade.
It would mean that the Brigade would have its own
Commander who would be listened to when he represented
Jewish things to higher authority. It would
mean direct access to the Divisional General, to
Ordnance, to supplies, and the hundred and one things
which go to make up the efficiency and cater for the
comfort of each unit of the Brigade.</p>

<p>No worse fate can befall any Battalion than to be
left out by itself in the cold, merely "attached" to a
Brigade or a Division, as the case may be. It is
nobody's child, and everybody uses it for fatigues and
every other kind of dirty work which is hateful to a
soldier.</p>

<p>It can be imagined, therefore, how grateful I was to
General Macready for promising a Jewish Brigade, for
I knew that such a formation would make all the difference
in the world to the success of the Jewish cause
as a whole and, what was of great importance, to the
good name of the Jewish soldier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">We Set Out for Palestine.</span></div>


<p>Towards the end of January, 1918, we were
notified that the 38th Battalion was to proceed
on Active Service to Palestine. This news was
received with great joy by all ranks, and every man
was granted ten days' leave to go home and bid
farewell to his family.</p>

<p>Of course, our pessimistic friends took every opportunity
of maligning the Jew from Russia, and said that
the men would desert and we should never see a tenth
of them again. I, however, felt otherwise, and had no
anxiety about their return. Nor was I disappointed,
for when the final roll-call was made there were not so
very many absentees, certainly no more than there would
have been from an ordinary British battalion, so here
again our enemies were confounded and disappointed,
for they had hoped for better things.</p>

<p>The Battalion was ordered to concentrate at Southampton
for embarkation on the 5th February. Two
days before this date Sir Nevil Macready ordered half
the Battalion to come to London to march through the
City and East End, before proceeding to Southampton.
This march of Jewish soldiers, unique in English
military history, proved a brilliant success. The men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were quartered in the Tower for the night, and on the
morning of the 4th February started from this historic
spot, in full kit and with bayonets fixed, preceded by
the band of the Coldstream Guards. The blue and
white Jewish flag as well as the Union Jack was
carried proudly through the City amid cheering crowds.
At the Mansion House the Lord Mayor (who had
granted us the privilege of marching through the City
with fixed bayonets) took the salute, and Sir Nevil
Macready was also present to see us march past.</p>

<p>As we approached the Mile End Road the scenes of
enthusiasm redoubled, and London's Ghetto fairly
rocked with military fervour and roared its welcome to
its own. Jewish banners were hung out everywhere,
and it certainly was a scene unparalleled in the history
of any previous British Battalion. Jabotinsky (who had
that day been gazetted to a Lieutenancy in the Battalion)
must have rejoiced to see the fruit of all his
efforts. After a reception by the Mayor of Stepney,
the march was resumed to Camperdown House, where
the men were inspected by Sir Francis Lloyd, G.O.C.
London District. He complimented them on their
smart and soldierly appearance, and made quite an
impressive speech, reminding them of the heroism and
soldierly qualities of their forefathers, and concluded by
saying that he was sure this modern Battalion of Jews
now before him would be no whit behind their forbears
in covering themselves with military glory.</p>

<p>An excellent lunch was provided for the men in
Camperdown House, where speeches were delivered
by the Chief Rabbi, the Mayor of Stepney, Mr. Kiley,
M.P., Mr. Joseph Cowen (the Chairman), and other
friends of the Battalion.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards the troops proceeded, amid more cheering,
to Waterloo, where, before they entrained for
Southampton, they were presented by Captain Fredman
with a scroll of the law.</p>

<p>My new Adjutant, Captain Leadley, who came to
take the place vacated by Captain Neill on promotion
to Major, had only just joined us on the morning of
our march. He was much surprised at the first Regimental
duty he was called upon to perform, which was
to take charge, on behalf of the Battalion, of the Scroll
of the Law. The excellent Jewish Padre who had
just been posted to us, and whose duty this should
have been, was with the remainder of the troops at
Plymouth.</p>

<p>I was very favourably impressed by Captain
Leadley from the first moment I saw him, and during
the whole time he remained with the Battalion I never
had cause to change my opinion. He was a splendid
Adjutant, and, in my opinion, was capable of filling a
much higher position on the Army Staff.</p>

<p>When the half Battalion reached Southampton, it
joined forces with the other half, which had been
brought to that place from Plymouth by Major Ripley,
who was now Second-in-Command in place of Major
MacDermot, who remained behind with the Depôt.
The whole Battalion proceeded to embark on the little
steamship <i>Antrim</i> on the 5th February.</p>

<p>Just as Captain Salaman was about to go on board,
he was confronted by another Medical Officer, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Halden Davis, R.A.M.C., who, at the last moment,
was ordered by the War Office to proceed with us
instead of Captain Salaman. I knew nothing about
this, and was naturally loth to lose Captain Salaman,
while he, on his part, was furious at the idea of being
left behind. However, there was no help for it, so back
he had to go to Plymouth. I think a certain number
of the shirkers in the Battalion may have been pleased
to see him go, for he stood no nonsense from gentlemen
of this kidney.</p>

<p>I had, for some time, been making strenuous efforts
to obtain the services of the Rev. L. A. Falk, the
Acting Jewish Chaplain at Plymouth, as our spiritual
guide, and luckily I was successful, for, at the last
moment, all difficulties were surmounted, and he joined
us as we embarked. I had had many warnings from
people who ought to have known better that he was
not a suitable man for the post, but I had seen him and
judged for myself, and I felt sure that he would suit
my Jews from Russia much better than a Rabbi chosen
because he was a Jew from England.</p>

<p>His work and his example to others, during the whole
time he served with us, were beyond all praise, and
I often felt very glad, when he was put to the test
of his manhood, that I had not listened to the voice of
the croaker in England.</p>

<p>The embarkation of the Battalion was complete by
5 p.m. on the 5th February, and after dark we steamed
out of the harbour and made for Cherbourg. It is
fortunate that we escaped enemy submarines, for the
little <i>Antrim</i> was packed to its utmost limits, not only
with the Jewish Battalion, but also with other troops.
We were kept at the British Rest Camp at Cherbourg
until the 7th, and then entrained for St. Germain,
near Lyons, where we rested from the 9th to the 10th.
From here we went on to Faenza, along the beautiful
French and Italian Riviera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>The arrangements throughout the journey for feeding
the men and giving them hot tea, etc., were not
perfect, but on the whole we did not fare badly.</p>

<p>We arrived at Faenza on the 13th, and we will
always cherish a kindly remembrance of this well-arranged
Rest Camp, and of the Staff in charge there.
The greatest credit is due to the Commandant, Colonel
Scott Harden, for having made a veritable garden in
the wilderness, and arranged everything for the comfort
and well-being of the tired and travel-stained
soldier passing through his capable hands. The only
drawback was that my unsophisticated boys were no
match for the Scotsmen whom they met in the Sergeant's
Mess! However that may be, we all came away
with the liveliest feelings of gratitude towards our kindly
hosts who had given us a real good time at Faenza.</p>

<p>During our halt at this delightful camp we gave a
concert and also a boxing exhibition to the Italian
officers of the garrison, both of which were much appreciated.
The Italian G.O.C., with all his Staff, also
came, and was highly interested in the exhibition. As
a special compliment to us, because we were the first
complete British Battalion to go through Italy, he reviewed
us in front of the Town Hall on our march to the
station at 10 o'clock at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>From Faenza we continued our journey to Taranto,
and on the way spent a few pleasant hours at Brindisi.
I walked along the docks, and, by the number of naval
vessels of all types moored there, I realized that there
could not be many Italian warships at sea; but it must
be remembered that the Mediterranean was at this time
infested with German and Austrian submarines, so that
our allies must not be blamed if they were taking as few
chances as possible with their ships of war. I remember
asking myself the question, what is the use of a ship
of war that is afraid to show itself on the open sea?</p>

<p>As we ran along the shores of the Adriatic, we were
all wondering whether an Austrian war vessel would
not suddenly dash up and blow us and our train to
pieces, but, wherever the Austrian fleet may have been
that day, fortunately for us it was not cruising on the
Adriatic Coast of Italy, and we reached Taranto on the
16th.</p>

<p>Thieving from the trains running through Southern
Italy was a pleasant pastime for the natives, but we
were fortunate in that we lost but little. We
had a couple of accidents during our long railway
journey which might, without luck, have proved disastrous.
Just before we reached Marseilles a coupling
about the middle of the train parted, and the rear carriages
were left standing on the line. Fortunately,
however, this was discovered before anything serious
occurred, and a relief engine brought the stranded portion
along. The same thing happened on the Italian
railway between Brindisi and Taranto, which delayed us
for about eight hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The behaviour of the men during the whole long
journey of nine days was exemplary, and I wired a
message to this effect to the War Office, for, as Russia
was just out of the War, there was some anxiety in
England as to how Russian subjects in the British Army
would behave on hearing the news.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact recruiting of Russian Jews in
England had been stopped after we left Southampton,
and many of the men naturally questioned the fairness of
the authorities in freeing slackers or late comers, while
retaining those who had promptly answered the call.</p>

<p>I cabled this point of view to the Adjutant-General on
reaching Taranto and received a reply that all such
matters could be settled in Egypt.</p>

<p>We remained basking in the sunshine of Southern
Italy for over a week. I met here an old friend of mine,
Captain Wake, who had been badly wounded in one of
our little wars on the East African coast many years
ago. Although minus a leg he was still gallantly doing
his bit for England.</p>

<p>We were encamped at Camino, a few miles from
Taranto, and our strength at this time was 31 officers,
and roughly 900 other ranks.</p>

<p>Two officers and about 70 N.C.O.'s and men sailed
on another boat from Marseilles, with the horses, mules
and wagons, under the command of Captain Julian,
M.C.</p>

<p>While we were at Taranto the Rev. L. A. Falk and I,
accompanied by Jabotinsky, searched for and eventually
found a suitable Ark in which to place the Scroll of the
Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of our last Sabbath service before we
embarked, I addressed the men, and, pointing to the
Ark, told them that while it was with us we need have
no fear, that neither submarine nor storm would trouble
us, and, therefore, that their minds might be easy on
board ship.</p>

<p>We embarked on the <i>Leasoe Castle</i> at 9 o'clock
a.m. on the 25th, steamed out of the harbour in the
afternoon, under the escort of three Japanese destroyers,
and arrived safely in Alexandria on the 28th February,
never having seen a submarine or even a ripple on the
sea throughout the voyage. Owing to this piece of
good luck my reputation as a prophet stood high! It is
a curious fact that on her next voyage the <i>Leasoe Castle</i>
was torpedoed and sunk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Back in the Land of Bondage.</span></div>


<p>When we landed at Alexandria on the 1st March
the Battalion was invited by the Jewish community,
headed by the Grand Rabbi, to commemorate
its safe arrival in Egypt by attending a special service
in the beautiful Temple in the street of the Prophet
Daniel.</p>

<p>The men got a splendid reception from the Alexandrians
as they marched to the Synagogue, where a most
impressive service was held, the Grand Rabbi giving
the soldiers a special benediction in the grand old
language of the Prophets.</p>

<p>After the service, refreshments were served by a
number of Jewish ladies, who could hardly indeed believe
that they were waiting upon a Battalion, composed of
men of their own race, who were now serving as Jewish
soldiers under the flag of England. Their faces glowed
with joy at the thought that a complete Jewish unit was
now before their eyes, and was on its way to assist in
releasing the land of their forefathers from the hand of
the Turkish oppressor.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to meet again those good
people who had helped me so wholeheartedly in looking
after the wives and dependents of my Zion Mule Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
men who had served in Gallipoli in 1915. Perhaps none
worked more zealously or gave more unselfish devotion
to those poor and miserable refugees than the Baroness
Rosette de Menasce. No matter what I wanted done
in the way of help or assistance for the impoverished
dependents, I could always rely on this beautiful and
charitable lady to see it through.</p>

<p>After lunch was over we marched to the station and
entrained for Helmieh, a village a few miles outside
Cairo, where the battalion was to be encamped, while
completing its training for the front. On arrival there
we found awaiting us Captain Julian with the transport
section complete, which had safely arrived a couple of
days previously.</p>

<p>At Cairo we were met by an emissary from Palestine,
who informed us that there was a great Jewish volunteer
movement on foot in Judæa, and that hundreds of young
men were eager to join the Army, and scores of Jewish
ladies were anxious to give their services as nurses, or
even as transport drivers.</p>

<p>This was cheering news&mdash;news which I naturally
thought would prove most welcome to the Commander-in-Chief
of the E.E.F.</p>

<p>The leading Jewish citizens of Cairo, not to be outdone
by their brethren of Alexandria, arranged with the
authorities, soon after our arrival, that we should attend
a religious service in the Chief Synagogue; the battalion
had a wonderful reception as it marched through the
City, which was thronged with cheering crowds. The
High Commissioner, General Sir Francis Reginald
Wingate, took the salute as the men marched past the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Residency, and evinced the greatest and most friendly
interest in this Jewish unit and the Jewish movement
generally.</p>

<p>I must mention here that the battalion was much indebted
to Mr. Maurice Gattegno, of Cairo, for the
immense amount of trouble he took in everything which
could be helpful, and the generous way in which he contributed
to all our comforts. He had an able helper in
his sister-in-law, Miss Viterbo (now Mrs. Hopkin), who
was untiring in her efforts on the men's behalf. Mr.
Franco and Mr. Cohen, of Alexandria, were also ardent
supporters of the battalion.</p>

<p>The Jews who have made Egypt their home are a
kindly hospitable people, and we owe them a debt of
gratitude for the way they received us and the interest
they took in our welfare. The land of the Pharaohs is
supposed to eat away the soul of a people and send
them after strange gods, but, in my intercourse with the
Jews of Egypt, I found that there are to-day many
devout men, who work, and pray, and give lavishly of
their substance, to the end that Israel may be restored.</p>

<p>The usual infantry training was carried out at
Helmieh&mdash;drill, physical training, bayonet fighting,
bombing, marching, musketry, signalling, etc., went on
from morning until night, and the men made excellent
progress. In fact, within a few weeks of our arrival in
Egypt, no one would have recognized in these bronzed
and well set up men, who walked about with a conscious
look of pride in themselves and their battalion, the pale,
pinched, miserable looking conscripts who joined up at
Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after our arrival in Egypt I sent the following
letter to the Commander-in-Chief:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cairo,<br />
5th March, 1918.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General,</span></p>

<p>No doubt you have heard of the arrival of the
Jewish Battalion in Egypt. I am very anxious to
see you in connection with the formation of a Jewish
Brigade, about which the War Office have given
me to understand they have made some communication
to you.</p>

<p>First of all there will be the position of the
Russians to discuss, as I have some hundreds of
these with me. They are at present performing
their duties cheerfully and well, and I have no fault
to find with their attitude; but, as Russia has signed
a separate peace, a new situation may arise which
I would like to be ready to meet. There are
already two more Jewish Battalions formed in
England, and one of these, the 39th, was under
orders to embark when I left Plymouth. Presumably,
it will arrive in Egypt soon. I hear of other
battalions for service with the Jewish Brigade being
formed in New York; and the Adjutant-General
informed me that it was probable that the French
authorities would transfer the Polish Jews now
serving in France to this Brigade. I am told that
there are several hundred young Jews waiting to
enlist in Palestine. There are a number more in
Cairo and Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>With your permission I would gladly commence
recruiting in these areas, and form a new battalion
here. For the purpose of enlisting the Palestine
volunteers, it would require a recruiting party to
make a trip round the Jewish colonies to collect the
recruits. I have an ideal party for such a duty in
my present battalion, all speaking Hebrew, headed
by an officer who knows Palestine. With your
approval I would send this party as soon as possible
on tour. Recruiting offices should also be opened
in Cairo and Alexandria, where I have promises of
every support from the Jewish communities of
these cities.</p>

<p>In England the Adjutant-General allowed transfers
of Jewish Officers, N.C.O.'s and men. I
hope you will be equally indulgent to those who
wish to join me from other units now under
your command.</p>

<p>I am strongly of the opinion that the training
ground of the Jewish Brigade should be in Judæa
itself, firstly for its great moral effect on the men;
secondly, the climate of Cairo during the training
months of March and April will make it practically
impossible to do much satisfactory work here. I
am convinced that twice the results could be obtained
in such a place as Jaffa, or other suitable
colony, while the health of the troops would greatly
benefit by the cooler climate. It would also enormously
stimulate recruiting in Palestine.</p>

<p>I know that the Home Government attach the
greatest importance to the moral effect of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Jewish Brigade on the outer world of Jewry&mdash;not
only in allied and neutral, but also in enemy countries&mdash;and
such full effect can only be obtained by
placing the Brigade in Palestine at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>There are some other points which I would
like to bring to your notice, but I will not add
to the length of this letter by mentioning them
now.</p>

<p>I should, however, be very glad to see you, and
discuss these matters generally with you, and hope
you will send instructions for me to report at your
headquarters at an early date.</p>

<div class="right">
Yours sincerely,<br />
(Signed) <span class="smcap">J. H. Patterson</span>.<br />

</blockquote>

<p>I got a reply from Major-General Louis Jean Bols,
the Chief of Staff, asking me to come to G.H.Q., but
at the same time informing me that General Allenby was
not in favour of my suggestions.</p>

<p>This was somewhat of a surprise to me, for at a time
when men were so badly needed, I thought that a Jewish
legion, of say 25,000 men, would have been
most acceptable on the Palestine front, and, had General
Allenby shown himself at all favourable to the idea of a
Jewish legion, it would at that time have been an easy
task to have obtained any number of men, from America
and elsewhere, to fight in Palestine.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, however, I proceeded to G.H.Q.,
where I had an interview with the Commander-in-Chief,
who told me quite frankly that he was not in sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with the War Office policy in sending this Jewish Battalion
to Palestine, and that he did not want any further
addition such as I suggested to his Forces.</p>

<p>At a subsequent interview which I had with his Chief
of Staff, I gathered that I need expect but little sympathy
for my battalion, as Major-General Louis Jean
Bols told me quite plainly that he was not favourably
disposed towards Jewish aspirations.</p>

<p>This anti-Jewish policy of General Allenby and his
Chief of Staff came as a shock to me, for I knew that it
was the settled intention of His Majesty's Government
to support these Jewish Battalions, and the Jewish claim
to Palestine, and I had been expecting quite a different
reception for my proposals from the E.E.F. authorities
to that which they received. I found, to my amazement,
that the policy adopted by the Staff towards this
Jewish Battalion, and the Jewish problem generally, ran
counter to the declared policy of the Home Government.
Alas! it seemed that another Pharaoh had arisen who
knew not Joseph; and once again we would be expected
to make bricks without straw, and become hewers of
wood and drawers of water. Instead of this new unit
being helped and encouraged, we were, on the contrary,
throughout our service in the E.E.F., made to feel that
we were merely Ishmaelites, with every hand uplifted
against us.</p>

<p>I knew full well what our fate would be once the
policy of G.H.Q. on this question was known, and, as I
will show later, the underlings of the Staff did not fail
to play up to the attitude of the higher command. I
hoped, however, that the battalion would do such good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
work that we would eventually overcome all prejudice.
We looked for no favours, and only wanted to be
treated as a battalion "all out" to do its duty.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief was of course aware by
this time of the Arab pretensions to Syria, and as his
mind was, no doubt, wholly centred on his own war
theatre, he was naturally anxious to placate the Arab at
all costs. The Arab was at his door, giving him certain
assistance by harrying the Turks to the East of the
Jordan, and the fact that the Hedjaz Army was fighting
on our side kept Bedouins and other marauders from
interfering with our lines of communication&mdash;no small
matter in Palestine and Syria. The intrusion of the Jew
was a disturbing factor to his policy, and was therefore
resented.</p>

<p>The local Military Authorities, however, seemed oblivious
of the fact that there was a much bigger question
involved than that which loomed so largely in their eyes
on the Palestine horizon. There was England's world
policy to be considered, and her Statesmen had already
decided that it was very much in her interests to win over
to her side Jewish help and sympathy the world over.
Let no one under-estimate what that help meant to the
Allies during the Great War. The Jewish element,
owing to the Balfour Declaration, came solidly to our
side in every land, and in America greatly helped
to counter the German propaganda which was fast gripping
hold of the United States. It was unfortunate
that this far-sighted and wise policy of our Imperial
Statesmen was never grasped by their local agents in
Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the E.E.F., so far as one on the spot could judge,
but scant heed was paid to any policy unless it bore on
local affairs and coincided with the point of view held
by G.H.Q. and the satellites revolving round it.</p>

<p>If only a little wise diplomacy had been employed,
I am strongly of the opinion that it would have been quite
practicable for the local authorities to have treated the
Jewish problem fairly and on the lines of the Balfour
Declaration and, at the same time, have retained the
Arabs on our side. After all the Arabs were as much
interested in the downfall of the Turk as we were ourselves,
and, to his honour be it said, the Emir Feisal
never showed himself hostile to Jewish aspirations. On
the contrary he expressed the utmost goodwill and
worked hand in hand with Dr. Weizmann for the
common good of both peoples.</p>

<p>The Jew and the Arab are necessary to each other in
the Near East, and if England wishes to retain her
Empire it is vital to her interests to keep friendly with
both. I am afraid that at the moment we are at a discount
to the East of Suez. During the stress of war
certain promises were made to the Arabs which appear
difficult to redeem, mainly due to the policy of France
in Syria. I admire France immensely, and that is why
I so much deplore her imperialistic aims beyond the
Lebanons. She is sowing a rich crop of troubles for
herself in these regions, and I am certain that ere long
we shall see her reaping a bitter harvest. I met a much
travelled French officer in Cairo, who had just relinquished
an administrative post in Beyrout, and he told
me that, if his Government was wise, it would clear out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of Syria, where it would have nothing but trouble for
generations to come. "If only," he went on, "England
would give us a bit of Africa and take Syria instead,
France would make a good bargain."</p>

<p>We, however, do not want Syria, but we do want to
see a strong and settled Arab state in these strictly Arab
regions, and I sincerely hope that our Statesmen will be
wise enough, and energetic enough, to bring about such
a desirable consummation. If we permit the Bolshevists
and Turks to oust us from our friendship with the Jews
and Arabs, and with King Hussein and his son the Emir
Feisal (now the King of Irak), upon whom we have alternately
blown hot and cold, just as it pleased France to
pipe the tune then we shall witness the beginning of the
end of our power and prestige in the Orient.</p>

<p>My trip to G.H.Q. was not quite in vain, for just
before we left Egypt sanction was given to enlist
Palestinian volunteers. I sent to Judæa a specially
trained recruiting party, all fluent Hebrew speakers,
under the command of Lieutenant Lipsey, to report to
Major James de Rothschild of the 39th Battalion, who
was the officer appointed to supervise this work in Egypt
and Palestine.</p>

<p>The response to Major de Rothschild's appeal was
enthusiastic&mdash;in fact his chief trouble was to keep out
grey-beards and unfledged youths, so eager were all to
join up.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Lipsey had some difficulty in keeping his
end up in Jerusalem, where there were many anti-Zionists,
but finally he worsted his opponents and
emerged triumphant with nearly 1,000 recruits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a translation of the Hebrew recruiting
poster sent throughout Palestine at this time:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Feast of the Passover.</span></div>


<p>At this time G.H.Q. was situated at a place called
Bir Salem (the Well of Peace), ten miles to the
east of Jaffa, and as, after my interview, I had the whole
day before me, I borrowed a motor-car and paid a flying
visit to Jerusalem, some thirty miles away to the eastward.
I will not attempt to describe here what I felt
as I approached the Holy City, along the winding road
which leads up to it through the rocky Judæan
mountains.</p>

<p>I entered the old walled city through the Jaffa Gate,
and was soon buried in its gloomy bazaars and labyrinthine
passages, seeking out the old historic spots which
I had reverenced from the days of my youth. I had but
a few hours for my explorations, but they were about the
busiest hours I ever spent, and although I have paid
many visits to Jerusalem since that date I have not forgotten
the glamour thrown over me by my first visit to
these sacred shrines and temples of antiquity.</p>

<p>I left Jerusalem at three in the afternoon and was back
in my camp at Helmieh within twenty-four hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i083.jpg"><img src="images/i083-t.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br />JERUSALEM</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The Battalion was attached to the School of Instruction
at Zeitoun (close to Helmieh), which was an unfortunate
arrangement, for our requirements were not
attended to, and we were often kept idle for long periods
owing to want of equipment, such as rifles, etc., to
enable the men to fire their musketry course. There
was no excuse for this, for there was plenty of equipment
of all kinds in the Ordnance Stores at Cairo. It
was the fault of the vicious system of having to get
everything we wanted through the School of Instruction,
whose staff did not seem to think that our requirements
needed speeding up. It was not until Brigadier-General
A. B. Robertson assumed command of the
school that matters were mended, for this officer took a
very friendly interest in us and did everything in his
power to help us along.</p>

<p>The Feast of the Passover was celebrated during our
stay at Helmieh. Thus history was repeating itself in
the Land of Bondage in a Jewish Military Camp, after
a lapse of over 3,000 years from the date of the original
feast.</p>

<p>I had considerable trouble with the authorities in the
matter of providing unleavened bread. However, we surmounted
all difficulties, and had an exceedingly jovial
first night, helped thereto by the excellent Palestinian
wine which we received from Mr. Gluskin, the head of
the celebrated wine press of Richon-le-Zion, near Jaffa.
The unleavened bread for the battalion, during the eight
days of the Feast, cost somewhat more than the ordinary
ration would have done, so I requested that the excess
should be paid for out of Army Funds. This was refused
by the local command in Egypt, so I went to the H.Q.
Office, where I saw a Jewish Staff Officer, and told him
I had come to get this matter adjusted. He said that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as a matter of fact, he had decided against us himself.
I told him that I considered his judgment unfair, because
the battalion was a Jewish Battalion, and the Army
Council had already promised Kosher food whenever it
was possible to obtain it, and it would have been a deadly
insult to have forced ordinary bread upon the men during
Passover. I therefore said that I would appeal against
his decision to a higher authority. He replied, "This
will do you no good, for you will get the same reply
from G.H.Q." He was mistaken, for I found the
Gentile, on this particular occasion, more sympathetic
than the Jew, and the extra amount was paid by order
of the Q.M.G., Sir Walter Campbell.</p>

<p>During our stay at this camp we were reviewed by
H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and, towards the end
of May, by the Commander-in-Chief, General Allenby.
Both these officers expressed themselves as pleased with
the smart soldierly appearance and steadiness of the
men, the Duke of Connaught remarking that "the men
all appeared to be triers."</p>

<p>Towards the close of our training at Helmieh, and
just as I was beginning to congratulate myself that the
battalion was shaping well and would soon be fit for
the front, I was staggered by the receipt of a letter from
G.H.Q. which aimed a deadly blow at our very existence.
It was nothing less than the proposal to break
up the battalion and allow the men to join Labour
units! This was undoubtedly a clever move on the part
of the Staff to rid themselves of the Jewish problem and,
at the same time, bring the derision of the world upon
the Jew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>It put me in a very difficult position, for I felt very
keenly that, if the battalion were disbanded and turned
over to Labour units, it would throw an indelible stigma
on Jewry.</p>

<p>I felt that it was my duty to protect the battalion from
the disgrace that would attach to it if it could be said
that the only Jewish unit raised for war purposes had
refused to fight&mdash;even for Palestine.</p>

<p>I therefore ordered a parade of the men by Companies,
and got the officers to point out to the men their
sacred duty, and gave instructions for any malcontents
to be sent before me for a final appeal. Only twelve
men were found who wished to join a Labour unit, and
to these twelve (I thought the number appropriate, as
it was one for each tribe) I made a strong personal
appeal, and after I had pointed out, in the best language
at my command, what a stigma they were placing on the
battalion, and on their fellow Jews throughout the
world, ten saw the error of their ways and cheerfully
said they wished to do their duty as soldiers, and continued
serving with the battalion, and I am glad to be
able to place on record that these ten did very well afterwards
in the field, one of them making the supreme
sacrifice. Two only remained obdurate to all appeals,
and insisted on being posted to a Labour unit, and I
think Jewry should remember them to all time. Their
names and numbers, and the evil which they did, are
recorded in the chronicles of the battalion. They were
turned out of the camp and drafted to a Labour unit
at a moment's notice, just as if they had been lepers.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April, 1918, we were delighted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
welcome the 39th Battalion from England, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Margolin, D.S.O., and
with them as M.O. I was glad to see Captain R.
Salaman. We gave the new arrivals a very hearty welcome,
the band of the 38th Battalion playing them into
Camp amid great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There was much friendly rivalry between these Jewish
Battalions, and honours were about easy in our sporting
competitions. We gave one or two "At Homes," to
which all Cairo seemed to flock, and I am sure our good
Cairene friends were favourably impressed with what
they saw of the Jewish Battalions at work and play.</p>

<p>Just about this time we were visited at Helmieh by
Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Joseph Cowen, and Mr. Aaronson.
All three gave addresses to the men. Mr. Aaronson
moved his audience to fury by graphically describing the
torture which the Turks had inflicted on his aged father
and young sister in Palestine, because they had dared
to help England. Mr. Aaronson lived to see his home
land freed from the Turk, but soon afterwards lost his
life in an aeroplane disaster while crossing from England
to France.</p>

<p>Dr. Weizmann has done much and suffered much
since he addressed us on that peaceful evening in the
Egyptian desert. If he could have foreseen everything
I doubt if even his undaunted soul would have faced unblenched
all the trials and tribulations which have fallen
to his lot since he undertook the arduous task of leading
his people back to the Land of Israel. His task has
been, if anything, more difficult than was that of the
great Lawgiver. The latter had only to surmount the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
obstinacy of one Pharaoh, while Dr. Weizmann had to
overcome that of thousands&mdash;not a few of them being
Jews!</p>

<p>What a pity it was that the modern leader had not the
power to dispense a few of the plagues which Moses
eventually found so efficacious. It is a striking testimonial
to the genius of Dr. Weizmann that so much has
already been accomplished towards the Restoration;
the fact that the Jewish people are now within sight of
their hearts' desire is, without doubt, mainly due to the
patient, persistent, and able diplomacy of this brilliant
leader.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, however that he was at all
times, and often in the teeth of bitter opposition, given
the ready help and sympathy of Mr. Lloyd George and
Sir Arthur Balfour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">We Set Out for the Front.</span></div>


<p>By the end of May our training was completed and
on the 5th June, 1918, we left Egypt for Palestine,
getting a very hearty "send-off" from Col.
Margolin and the 39th Battalion.</p>

<p>Before we set out I had the gratification of receiving
from General Robertson the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Savoy Hotel,<br />
Cairo,<br />
4th June, 1918.</span><br />
</div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel Patterson</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>On the eve of your departure for the front I
desire to wish you and the officers and men of the
38th Royal Fusiliers God-speed, and success in the
tasks which you may be called upon to undertake
in the future.</p>

<p>From what I have seen of your battalion I know
it will uphold the glorious traditions of the Regiment
to which it has the honour to belong, and its
career will be watched with interest and sympathy
by its well-wishers in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Personally I am proud to have been associated
with the battalion even for a short time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Its well-known good behaviour must be a source
of satisfaction to you, because that will provide a
sound foundation on which to build a solid battle
discipline, while the progress it made in the training
at Helmieh augurs well for its future efficiency.</p>

<div class="right">
Yours sincerely,<br />
(Signed) A. B. <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>.<br />

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Battalion entrained smoothly and quickly at the
railway siding close to our camp and we were soon rolling
onward to realize our ideals and aspirations in the
Promised Land.</p>

<p>Our Chaplain, who was a man of insight and vision,
arranged that our trumpets should sound, and that a
short prayer should be said by the troops as they
entered, for the first time, the ancient land of their
Fathers.</p>

<p>All through the night, as we sped across the Sinai
Desert seated in our open trucks, we could see the
funnel of the engine belching forth a pillar of flame, and
we were greatly reminded of the wanderings of the forefathers
of these men in this very Desert, who in their
night journeys were always guided by a pillar of fire.
Nor did the simile cease as dawn broke, for then the
pillar of flame turned into a cloud of smoke shot up into
the still morning air.</p>

<p>Soon after sunrise we passed Gaza, the scene of
Samson's exploits, and saw, in the distance, the hill to
the top of which he carried the gates of the town. Gaza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
may be considered the bridgehead leading into or out
of Egypt. In Biblical times it was always a thorn in
the side of the Jews, and they were never able to capture
it. It was, however, captured from the Philistines on
various occasions both by the Egyptians on their expeditions
into Syria and by the Syrians on their expeditions
into Egypt. No army could afford to leave it
untaken on their lines of communication. It will be
remembered that we ourselves made two costly failures
here in our first attempts to enter Palestine during the
Great War. The third time of course we succeeded,
and with its fall the whole plain of Philistia was at our
mercy.</p>

<p>As we rolled onward historical places cropped up
every few miles and kept us spellbound with interest.
Beersheba was away thirty miles to the east, and we
hoped in good time to see Dan; meanwhile the Shephelah
downs ran parallel to us, ending up with Mount
Gezer where David won a victory over the Philistines.
This hill was well known to every invading force that
has passed through Palestine, and around its base
gallant men of many nations have fallen.</p>

<p>In the distance, like a cobalt mist, loomed the mountains
of Ephraim and of Judæa, while the "utmost
sea" occasionally shimmered on our left.</p>

<p>About noon we steamed through a grove of olives
into Ludd (the ancient Lydda), where we detrained. It
was one of the hottest days I have ever experienced,
and our march to Surafend, under a blazing midday
midsummer sun, loaded up as we were with full kit, was
a severe test of the endurance of the men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><br />CHOIR OF THE JEWISH REGIMENT</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>Almost as soon as we reached our bivouac at Surafend
the Jewish Colonists of Richon-le-Zion, Jaffa,
Rechoboth and all the surrounding colonies came out
in their hundreds with flags and banners, on foot, on
horseback, and in chariots, to greet us, and show us how
much they thought of their brethren who had come all
the way from England to help them to redeem their
country. Amongst the Zionists from Jaffa and Richon-le-Zion
were many scores of both men and women
who had already volunteered for service with the
Army.</p>

<p>It was an inspiring sight to see how these young men
and women rode and managed their horses. No cowboy
of the Western States of America could be more expert.
It is quite evident that a new and free Jewish race is
arising among the colonists of Palestine, for even the
small children of eight and nine years of age can ride
and manage horses with ease. We celebrated our first
Sabbath in Palestine at Surafend, where special prayers
for the occasion were recited, including one composed
by the Haham Bashi of Egypt, Rabbi Simeon.</p>

<p>Richon-le-Zion, besides sending its quota of young
men and women to greet us, sent us also three casks of
choice Richon wine, which in those thirsty days the
battalion much appreciated.</p>

<p>We remained at Surafend for three days, and during
our stay there, were inspected in our bivouac by General
Allenby, who again expressed himself as well pleased
with all he saw.</p>

<p>Major James de Rothschild came over from Jaffa,
where he was then doing recruiting duty, and gave us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
God-speed as we left our pleasant surroundings at Surafend
for our journey to the Front.</p>

<p>We marched off at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the
9th June, and reached El Kubab at 8.15 the same
evening. Personally I only went half-way, for I was
recalled to Cairo to preside at a General Court-Martial
assembled there for the trial of three Royal Air
Force officers who had been performing some unauthorised
stunts. I rejoined the Battalion at Umm
Suffah, a few miles short of the Turkish lines. While
the 38th was at this place there was an air raid on our
lines, but no damage was done.</p>

<p>From El Kubab the Battalion went to Beit Nuba.
They left on the 11th, and reached Harith the same
day, where they came under the orders of Brigadier-General
E. M. Morris, a first-rate soldier commanding
the 10th Irish Division. They marched out of Harith
at 5 p.m. on the 12th, and arrived at Umm Suffah at
10 p.m. the same day.</p>

<p>We were now among the hills of Samaria and the
transport was much delayed on this march owing to the
frightfully rough and stony road. Several wheels got
broken and, as a matter of fact, the transport, with the
food, etc., did not arrive until the early morning of the
13th.</p>

<p>On the 13th June the Battalion was placed in
Divisional Reserve. On Saturday the 15th it first came
under shell fire while we were holding Divine Service.
Shells exploded quite close to the men, but no damage
was done, and the battalion took its baptism of fire quite
cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>During the week that followed the Companies were
posted to units already in the line, to gain some knowledge
of the country, and to learn the nature of the
duties to be carried out in the fighting zone.</p>

<p>Before we took our place in the line we were inspected
by the G.O.C. 10th Division, who, when the inspection
was over, expressed himself as very pleased with the
general appearance and steadiness of the men.</p>

<p>On the 27th June A, B, and C Companies were detailed
to garrison supporting points on the front occupied
by the 31st Infantry Brigade, to which we were now
attached, and which was under the command of Brigadier-General
W. B. Emery, a genial gunner.</p>

<p>Battalion Headquarters and D Company moved up to
the front on the 30th June and took over the second
line of supporting points, from a place known as the
Wadi Tiyur to the Wadi Belat, just to the west of the
main road running from Jerusalem to Nablus (the
ancient Shechem), where it cuts the Wadi Jib some
twenty miles north of the Holy City.</p>

<p>On the 3rd July the Battalion relieved 2/101
Grenadiers in the left sector of the 31st Infantry Brigade
front, the relief being commenced after dark and completed
by 10.15 p.m.</p>

<p>We found the piece of country we took over most interesting.
We occupied the summits of the hills facing
the Turkish position, and were responsible for some
three or four miles of front.</p>

<p>Our right rested upon Jiljilia, a pretty hamlet of
Samaria, and our left upon Abwein, a strong, stone-built
Arab village, nestling half-way down a steep hillside, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by fig and olive trees. Our line on the hills
between these two places twisted and turned about like
a snake, for of course we conformed to the nature of the
ground. Our frontage towards the enemy descended
into the valley, some 200 feet below, in a series of rocky
terraces, each having a drop of from six to twenty feet.
These terraces and hill slopes were dotted with olive
trees. A wadi, called the Wadi Gharib, ran through
the narrow valley which lay at the bottom, and then
there was a very steep ascent up the opposite side to the
Turkish line.</p>

<p>Our front wire was actually a few hundred yards down
over the crest of the hill on the Turkish side, for from
this position we had a better field of fire.</p>

<p>When we took over this position from Lieut.-Colonel
Strong, the O.C. of the 2/101 Grenadiers, a considerable
amount of work necessarily remained to be done,
building stone sangars, digging trenches, making roadways,
and generally improving the position in every
possible way.</p>

<p>Our line was divided into four sections, one company
guarding each part, Major Neill on the extreme right
holding Jiljilia, and Captain Brown with his Company
in Abwein.</p>

<p>We at once assumed a vigorous offensive policy; our
patrols were pushed out every night down into the
valley, and often up to the Turkish wire on the opposite
hills. During daylight only the Observation Posts were
manned along our front wire. A couple of men in each
vantage point, equipped with field glasses or telescopes,
and provided with a telephone, kept us informed of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
movement in the Turkish lines. As soon as darkness
had fallen each company marched its men over the crest
of the hills and took up position in the sangars and
defence posts along the barbed wire fence. All night
long work and building, etc., went on, the unfortunate
men getting very little rest. Listening posts were
established well out beyond the wire, and strong patrols
went down the ledges looking for trouble in Turkish
territory. Our aggressive policy thoroughly scared the
Turks, so much so that they never once attempted to
come anywhere near our front.</p>

<p>Just as dawn was breaking, having made certain by
means of patrols and scouts that no Turks were in the
neighbourhood, the troops returned to their bivouacs
behind the crest, leaving only the Observation Posts on
the watch.</p>

<p>I had a very good Intelligence Officer in Lieutenant
Simon Abrahams, who explored "no man's land" very
methodically, and who earned a high measure of praise
from our Brigade Commander. Abrahams would go
out with a daring scout like Pte. Angel (who afterwards
won the M.C.) and sketch roads, routes, tracks,
etc., right under the very noses of the Turks, and so
careful was he, and so secretive, that his presence on the
debatable ground was never even suspected by the
enemy.</p>

<p>It might be thought that when the men had finished
their night's vigil they would be allowed to rest, but
instead of this, as soon as a hasty breakfast had been
swallowed, they immediately had to fix up barbed wire
entanglements, build stonework redoubts, gun emplacements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
make railways down the hills, or bury animals
which had died or been killed in somebody else's camp.</p>

<p>Anything and everything was demanded from the battalion,
and every call, no matter how distasteful, was
responded to with readiness, if not with cheerfulness.
All the time we were holding this bit of the Nablus
front, from the Wadi Jib to the Wadi Gharib, the men
were constantly running about on arduous jobs and as
busy as bees.</p>

<p>About this time there was a rumour that we were
soon to take the offensive, and I was especially pleased
when I got a confidential communication from our
Brigade Commander ordering me to prepare a careful
reconnaissance of the country to our left front, where
the surprise attack on the Turks was to be made. A
good track up to the enemy wire, concealed as much as
possible from his view, had to be found, the general idea
being that once there we would make a sweep to the
right along the Turkish front opposed to our lines. I
detailed Captain T. B. Brown for this important task,
which he carried out admirably. A suitable route by
which to return with the expected prisoners and loot
had also to be discovered and sketched, and Lieutenant
Simon Abrahams was in his element when I selected
him for this adventure.</p>

<p>The hope of coming to grips with the Turks buoyed
us up considerably, and the prospect of a battle in which
we felt sure we would do well helped us through the
trying and weary round of daily routine.</p>

<p>Our Brigadier was a soldier whom we all liked, but
he had a mania for putting up barbed-wire fences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
at last we erected so much on our front that we caused
a serious shortage of this material in the E.E.F., and
further wiring was prohibited.</p>

<p>On the 10th July our Transport was shelled. Luckily
only one mule was killed and one wounded.</p>

<p>We were heavily bombarded by guns of various
calibres at 2.30 in the morning on July 14th, but it was
an absolute waste on the part of the Turks, for not
a single casualty of any kind was sustained.</p>

<p>On this day the Turks and Germans attacked in the
Jordan Valley and got severely mauled by the Anzac
Mounted Division. We, too, expected an attack, but
soon after dawn the shelling ceased and the situation
became normal.</p>

<p>While the Battalion was holding the forward trenches
I always made a round of the posts every night to see
that every one was on the alert and that they knew what
to do in case of attack.</p>

<p>I made the men place white stones along the wire so
that they could take aim on them in case of a Turkish
assault in the dark, and arranged bombing parties at
various points; in fact, we were all ready to give the
enemy a very warm reception if he ever came our way.</p>

<p>Once, on going my rounds, I heard a noise a little way
down the hill, so I ordered a young soldier to throw a
bomb; he failed to get the pin quite out and slipped the
"dud" into his great-coat pocket; fortunately, a sergeant
standing near saw what had happened and, on
examining the "dud," found the pin practically
released! The slightest movements would have set the
bomb off and we should all have been blown sky high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter at what hour I returned from my tour of
inspection along the battle line, I always found my faithful
orderly, Corporal Hutchinson, awaiting me with a
"nightcap" such as could only be mixed by the dexterous
hand of an old campaigner. Hutchinson served
with me when I commanded a battalion of the Irish
Fusiliers, and followed my fortunes when I went to
command the Dublin Fusiliers. On asking him if he
would go with me to the Jewish Battalion, he replied,
"Oh, be the hokey!&mdash;but shure, Sir, that's where you'll
be wanting me the most."</p>

<p>Hutchinson remained with me until we set out for the
Jordan Valley, when he was taken ill and invalided home.
I missed him sadly, for he used to remain by my tent
door and ward off any undesirable intruder like a well-trained
watch dog. A more faithful, loyal and trust-worthy
soldier never shouldered a rifle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Nablus Front.</span></div>


<p>On the 17th July we were transferred to the 60th
Division and attached to one of its Brigades.</p>

<p>We were very sorry to leave the 10th Division, for we
had made many good friends all round, and our Divisional
and Brigade Commanders had always treated us
fairly and justly.</p>

<p>On the evil day of our transfer a fatal accident befell
Lieutenant B. Wolffe. He was in charge of the transport
wagons and was engaged in loading up supplies at
the Ordnance Depôt. The drivers were, of course, dismounted
and standing by their teams while the work of
loading was going ahead. A sudden noise frightened
one of the teams, and off the four horses careered at a
mad gallop. They were heading straight for some
troops standing near, and Lieutenant Wolffe, seeing
this, made a gallant attempt to stop them by springing
at the heads of the leaders as they dashed past. Unfortunately
they were going too fast for him, and he was
dragged under their feet, the wagon passing over his
body.</p>

<p>I visited him in hospital, as did also our Chaplain and
others, and we cheered him up as much as possible, but
he died on the 20th, and his death cast a gloom over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
whole battalion, for he was a most conscientious officer,
a good Jew, and well liked by all ranks. He was buried
with full Jewish rites, a "Minyan" from the battalion
attending.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief in General Orders eulogised
the gallant attempt which he made when he sacrificed his
own life in his plucky effort to save others.</p>

<p>On the 24th July I was requested by Dr. Weizmann to
bring a representative party of officers and men of the
battalion to a most interesting ceremony at Jerusalem&mdash;the
laying of the foundation stones of the Hebrew
University On Mount Scopus.</p>

<p>In the days of her past greatness the law was expounded
at Jerusalem. It is quite possible that again,
even in our own days, we shall hear a message of peace
and goodwill issue forth from the Temple of Learning
overlooking the Holy City.</p>

<p>The site chosen for the building is a magnificent one.
It looks down on the domes and minarets of Jerusalem
on the one side, and, on the other, overlooks the Jordan
Valley and the Dead Sea, with the green hills of Moab
looming in the distance.</p>

<p>The ceremony itself was a most interesting one.
The Commander-in-Chief was present; also all the civil
and religious heads of the Jewish, Christian, and
Moslem communities, while a vast multitude of people
of all creeds thronged along the slopes of Scopus from
Jerusalem&mdash;a seemingly good omen for future peace and
concord. It was a truly inspiring and historic occasion,
and augured well for the future greatness of the University.
Stones were laid by the Christian Bishop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Jerusalem and by the Mufti (the Chief Mohammedan
dignitary). One was also laid by Dr. Weizmann in the
name of the Jewish Regiment, while what perhaps
appealed to me most of all was the part taken by Jewish
children in laying a stone representing the Hope of
Israel.</p>

<p>On my return to the Battalion I found the Headquarters
encamped in a pretty grove of olives on the
Inniskilling Road, some two miles behind the firing line.
While we were here our Chaplain, the Rev. L. A. Falk,
one day discovered a red granite column embedded in
the side of a hill. This we unearthed and, on measuring
it, found that it was about 12 feet high and about 2 feet
in diameter. We erected it in our camp in a grove of
olive trees. I much perturbed our good Rabbi by
chaffingly suggesting to him that we had been erecting
an altar to Baal, in a grove, in one of the high places!
Our find got noised abroad, and the Governor of Jerusalem,
Colonel Storrs, with his assistant, Lord William
Percy, motored out from Jerusalem to see it. They had
lunch with us, and I was delighted to note that Lord
William Percy took a keen interest in preserving the
fauna of Palestine, and had induced General Allenby to
impose strict limitations on the shooting of birds and
beasts.</p>

<p>Our transfer to the 60th Division did not, for the time
at least, result in any change in our position in the line,
but, almost from the moment we joined the new Brigade,
we felt the hostility shown towards all things Jewish by
the Brigade Commander. I endeavoured to counter his
prejudice against the battalion, during a friendly after-dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chat, by pointing out the immense debt we owed
to the "People of the Book" for all they have done
towards civilising and humanizing the world for thousands
of years. During their struggle for existence
through centuries of exile, in countries where every form
of torture and repression had been in vogue against them,
they never lost their age-long Hope of a Restoration.
The General seemed, like many others, to have a very
vague idea as to the aim of the Zionists, which is simply
to establish a National Home in Palestine where Jewish
life, rooted in its own soil, would have an opportunity
of developing on modern lines, in accordance with its
own ideals. I gave the Brigadier some new ideas on
Jews, but all my eloquence was in vain, for I failed to
convert him, and he hinted that I was only wasting my
time by being mixed up with a Jewish unit!</p>

<p>But although the Brigadier was right in one way when
he said "You will get nothing out of it," yet in another
way he was altogether wrong, for I have got a very
great deal out of my service with this Jewish Battalion.
I have had the satisfaction of proving that, in spite of
all obstacles placed in its path, this new unit showed that
it was worthy of the best traditions of the Maccabæans,
those doughty Jewish soldiers who, on many a well-fought
field, defeated the legions of Antiochus and freed
Judæa from a foreign yoke.</p>

<p>But it is not by fighting alone that a good battalion is
proved, and the Jewish unit was tested in many ways
as this record will show.</p>

<p>There was no respite from such work as digging
trenches, building stone sangars, and constructing roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
along the hill-sides, by day and by night; nevertheless,
every soldierly duty allotted was carried out cheerfully
and promptly.</p>

<p>The rumour which had got abroad about the attack
on the Turkish trenches opposite our front now crystallised
into definite shape, and the actual date of the attack
was often hinted at.</p>

<p>A few days before the assault was to take place our
Brigadier gave us the special job of making stone emplacements,
almost within sight of the Turks, just above
the village of Jiljilia, and as we fondly hoped we would
have a place in the assaulting column, all hands worked
with a will, especially our two Christian Lithuanians,
Stenelus and Sterilitis; these men amazed the British
gunners by the ease with which they placed huge blocks
of stone in position&mdash;all done by sheer strength of muscle
combined with hearty good will.</p>

<p>This particular piece of work was under the supervision
of Major Neill, and, as it had to be done in record
time, his task was no easy one, but, fortunately for him
and his Company, the Turks never spotted what was
going on, and before we left these parts Major Neill
saw the guns safely emplaced without suffering a single
casualty.</p>

<p>All this stone work on the steep sides of a hill, coupled
with heavy marching to and fro, and scrambling up and
down, was not good for the men's clothing, which soon
got worn, ragged and dirty. A false step on a slippery
slope meant that the seat of a man's flimsy shorts was
rent asunder, and it was quite usual to see the tail of a
shirt hanging out! Yet, no matter how ragged and disreputable-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the men were, I found it impossible to
get any renewal of clothing, although it was freely handed
out to other units.</p>

<p>It seemed as if it were a joy to some people to be able
to withhold necessary articles of clothing, such as shirts,
boots, socks, shorts, etc., and keep the men working
on dirty jobs, and then say with glee, "Look at the
ragged dirty Jews."</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we could not obtain
enough water even to wash our faces, for every drop
had to be carried up the precipitous sides of the hills on
camels as far as they could clamber, and then by mules
and donkeys up the steeper parts. Often there was a
shortage of the precious fluid even for tea-making.</p>

<p>I wrote urgent letters again and again, and protested
that the men were unfit to march for want of shoes, and
that many of them were actually exposing their nakedness
for want of clothing. I sent my Quartermaster,
Lieutenant Smythe, day after day, to the Ordnance
Stores trying to extract necessary articles, but all in
vain! We were nobody's children, and consequently we
could get nothing. I saw the Brigadier, and represented
to him that in many cases our men were ragged,
shirtless, sockless, and bootless, but if he made any
representations on our behalf there was no result.</p>

<p>Had we belonged to a Brigade instead of being merely
"attached" most of our troubles would never have
arisen, but the policy adopted by the local Staff was to
keep us as "wandering Jews," pitched from one
Brigade to another, in a continuous round of General
Post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a heart-breaking experience as any soldier will
understand.</p>

<p>At last I rode over to my old Gallipoli friend, Colonel
O'Hara, who was on the Staff of the 10th Division, and
he, like the good soldier that he is, helped me out of my
difficulty as far as it lay in his power.</p>

<p>What a difference it makes when one meets a good
Staff Officer! Not nearly enough care is given to the
task of selecting the right men for this all-important
branch of the Army. They are too often selected for
any reason except the right one, viz., efficiency.</p>

<p>The Brigade to which we were attached was fortunate
in having at least one good Staff Officer. The Brigade
Major was a thoroughly capable soldier, and always out
to help in every way in his power.</p>

<p>The Brigadier often caused me much inward amusement
by pointedly appealing in my presence to the
judgment of a certain Colonel X, an officer junior to
me, who was in command of a section on our right.
If I had a sangar built which commanded a good
field of fire, it was sure to be found fault with, and
another had to be built in a site chosen by their joint
wisdom.</p>

<p>One night the gallant Brigadier came across the spot
where I had my outlook post established; he thought
it was in the wrong place, of course, and consulted his
friend, Colonel X, as to where it should be.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it ought to be on the top of this
house?" said the General. The Colonel climbed to the
top of the house, gazed round in the inky darkness,
came down again, and said he quite agreed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
General, as all good, well-trained Colonels, with an eye
to the main chance, invariably do!</p>

<p>I was then ordered to put the outlook on the top of the
house, which had a flat roof, where a man would be
seen by every Turk for miles round! Needless to say,
I never placed an observer in this absurd position.</p>

<p>Just about this time one of my men, quite a youth,
was found asleep at his post, and as this is about the
most serious crime of which a sentry can be guilty, he
was tried by General Court Martial and sentenced to
death.</p>

<p>A few days later a telegram came from the Provost
Marshal ordering me to send the condemned man under
strong escort, with two senior non-commissioned officers,
to the prisoners' compound some distance away. I
feared that the unfortunate lad would be shot at dawn,
and as I knew he had been working exceedingly hard,
day and night, for 48 hours before he was found asleep
at his post, and was of good character and very young,
I determined to try to save him. I therefore sent a
private wire to General Allenby asking him on these
grounds to reprieve him.</p>

<p>My friend the Brigadier saw the wire before it was
despatched and stopped it. However, one of my
men in the Signal Office told me of this, so I immediately
wrote a confidential letter to General Allenby,
gave it to a motor-cyclist, and sent him off post haste
to G.H.Q., some thirty miles away, telling him to
ride for all he was worth, as a man's life hung on his
speed.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that not only did General Allenby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
reprieve the man and reduce the sentence to a certain
number of years' imprisonment, but he suspended even
that punishment, provided the man proved himself
worthy of forgiveness by doing his duty faithfully in the
battalion.</p>

<p>The young soldier returned to us overjoyed and full
of gratitude for his release. He proved himself worthy
in every respect, and was never afterwards called upon
to do a day's imprisonment.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with having held up the wire, the
Brigadier motored some miles away to report the matter
to the Divisional General, Sir John Shea.</p>

<p>I was duly haled before the General, not knowing for
what reason, until he said, "You know you will get
yourself into trouble if you go sending telegrams direct
to the Commander-in-Chief." It then dawned on me for
the first time why I had been sent for.</p>

<p>I explained all the circumstances to the General, and
said that, in such an emergency, I felt justified in what
I had done. Besides, I said, I had not addressed the
Commander-in-Chief as such, but as General Allenby,
an officer whom I had known for many years. I also
confessed that, when I found that the wire had been
blocked, I had immediately written a letter of appeal to
General Allenby, and had sent it off by a special cyclist
despatch rider.</p>

<p>The General pretended to be so horrified at this that
he needed a cocktail to revive him&mdash;in which I may add
he asked me to join him. I do not know what he
thought of the Brigadier's action, but I can leave the
reader to imagine what I thought of it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days later, when I was breakfasting with
General Shea, I was much amused when he told me that
when he was at home his children insisted on his reading
a lion story to them every evening out of "The Man-Eaters
of Tsavo"!</p>

<p>From the frequent consultations between the
Brigadier and his friend Colonel X I felt that something
was on foot, but little realised that it was a matter which,
if carried out, would strike a blow at the very identity
of the Jewish Battalions. This, however, soon became
evident.</p>

<p>Shortly after my interview with the Divisional General
I was called to the telephone to speak to the Brigadier,
who said, apparently with great satisfaction, "I want to
tell you that your Battalion and the 39th Battalion
(which was then on its way up from Egypt) are to be
brigaded with two West Indian Battalions, and you are
to be placed under the command of Colonel X, who is
now a General and has come to live near my camp.
You will find General X a very nice man." I thanked
the Brigadier for his interesting information and hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>It was now clearly my duty to stop this second
attempt to destroy the identity of the Jewish Battalions
in Palestine or resign my command. It was
no easy task to achieve, because our good friends had
worked underground all the time, and sprang this surprise
upon me only when it became an accomplished
fact; Colonel X had actually been appointed to the command,
a Brigade Major and a Staff Captain had been
posted to the new Brigade, while the transport and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ordnance section of the formation had been already
organized and sent to Jericho.</p>

<p>The Staff at G.H.Q. had, of course, arranged the
whole affair, and it would be no easy task to get the
Commander-in-Chief to countermand the Brigade
formation. I felt that a very firm stand must be taken
if this blow aimed at Jewish prestige was to be averted.</p>

<p>I accordingly wrote a strong letter direct to General
Allenby, pointing out that, if such a scheme were carried
out, it would involve very grave issues. The Adjutant-General
at the War Office had promised that the Jewish
Battalions would be formed into a Jewish Brigade, and
to depart from this declared policy would be looked upon
as a direct slight, both by the Jewish Battalions and by
Jewry the world over. Loth as I was to worry the
Commander-in-Chief, I considered it my duty to him,
to my men, to myself, and to Jewry to see that Jewish
interests were not trampled upon without a protest while
I retained command. I requested therefore that the
orders should be cancelled, and, if not, that I should be
relieved of my command.</p>

<p>That my attitude on this question was correct was
proved by the receipt of a most friendly reply from
General Allenby, in which he thanked me for my letter
and said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see the undesirability of brigading Jewish with
West Indian Battalions, and I have decided not to
do so. I shall form a provisional Brigade of the two
Jewish Battalions until a complete Jewish Brigade
can be formed, and they will be under you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole tone of this letter showed that the
C.-in-C. had been badly advised by his Staff in this
attempted amalgamation of the Jewish with the West
Indian Battalions.</p>

<p>A few hours after I had received General Allenby's
communication a wire came from G.H.Q. cancelling all
the orders which had already been issued with regard to
the formation of the new Brigade.</p>

<p>Thus I won the second round in my fight for fair play
for the Jewish Battalions and Jewish ideals generally.</p>

<p>I realized that my stand for justice would be bitterly
resented by certain individuals at G.H.Q., and that,
sooner or later, I would be penalised for having upset
their attempted little coup.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">We March to the Jordan Valley.</span></div>


<p>Within two days of the receipt of General
Allenby's letter cancelling the mixed Brigade
formation, we were suddenly ordered to leave the cool
and pleasant hill-tops of Ephraim and march down to
the sweltering heat and fever-stricken desolation of the
Jordan Valley, 1,300 feet below sea level, in the very
hottest and most unhealthy month of the year.</p>

<p>We, of course, took our orders for the deadly Valley
quite cheerfully, feeling that it was "not ours to reason
why," but we did feel that it was a blow below the belt
to be taken out of the line on the Nablus front, just as an
attack, for which we had done most of the spade work,
was about to be made.</p>

<p>Had we remained with General Emery, I feel sure
that he would have given us a chance to show our
mettle in the raid which was timed to take place on 12th
August, 1918.</p>

<p>Even when we were transferred to the Brigade in the
60th Division we still looked forward to taking part in
this move, and, as I have already mentioned, we slaved
away at every kind of preparation for the affair, but, alas,
we were taken out of the line, and ordered to march to
a new front, just three days before the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>It almost looked as if our enemies feared we would do
well, and our prowess would then get noised abroad to
the discomfiture of our detractors.</p>

<p>On the 9th August we marched from our pretty camp
at Inniskilling Road, where we had revelled in the grateful
shade of the olive trees which abound there, and took
the road, bag and baggage, for Ram Allah, our first
halt, where we were to bivouac. Here we were to get
further orders from the G.O.C. 53rd Division, whose
headquarters were in that ancient town. It was midnight
when we got to our camp, where we found that
someone had carefully chosen a site for us which was
literally one mass of stones. It must have been the
favourite place of execution in olden days when stoning
to death was in vogue, and the stones had never since
been gathered up! There was no grumbling, however;
every man cleared a little patch whereon to lie down on
his waterproof sheet, and slept the sleep of the tired.
We remained at this delectable spot for the best part of
two days, and on the afternoon of the 11th we marched
to Jerusalem, where we came under the orders of the
Desert Mounted Corps.</p>

<p>We bivouacked about a mile or so short of Jerusalem,
and, as the camp was reached long after dark, the City
remained hidden until dawn next morning. I had a
cheery and welcome dinner the evening we arrived with
Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Chetwode, who commanded
the 20th Corps, at his headquarters at the
German Hospice on the Mount of Olives.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><br />THE WAILING WALL AT JERUSALEM<br />
(<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_93">93</a>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>I was awake about 5 o'clock next morning, just as the
mist was beginning to disperse, and woke up everybody
all round about me to have their first look at the Holy
City. My officers were all very tired, so merely gave
one peep at it out of sleepy eyes, and then buried themselves
once more in their blankets. Later on the men
spent the whole of the forenoon visiting Jerusalem, and
especially the celebrated Wailing Wall, which is the only
authentic portion of the Temple enclosure which still
remains. Its huge blocks of stone seem to be as indestructible
as the indomitable race which designed,
shaped, and placed them in position so many centuries
ago. The Jewish "bevel" is a noticeable feature in
the stones. Here the Jews for nearly two thousand
years have wept and wailed, placing their foreheads
against the walls and copiously watering the masonry
with their tears. The wailing of the Jews at this remnant
of their Temple is one of the most pathetic and curious
sights I have ever witnessed.</p>

<p>The Jewish mendicants who are allowed to congregate
in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall are not a pleasing
spectacle, and I hope that one of the first acts of the
Zionists will be the removal of this blot on Jewry.</p>

<p>Bethlehem can be reached in a few minutes by motor
from Jerusalem, and near to it Rachel's tomb stands
by the roadside, while almost opposite is the field in
which Ruth gleaned.</p>

<p>At 4.30 in the afternoon of this day (12th August) we
marched off under the walls of Jerusalem, past the
Damascus Gate, skirted the Garden of Gethsemane, and
wended our way on to the road which would take us
down to Jericho. It was a lovely sight as we halted and
looked back over the Valley of Jehoshaphat, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
brook Kidron between us and the walls of the venerable
city, the beautiful Mosque of Omar overshadowing the
Temple area, the mysterious Golden Gates fronting us,
sealed up, and the westering sun gilding Mount Zion.</p>

<p>I have seen Jerusalem since from many points, but
the view from the corner of the Jericho Road, where it
skirts the Mount of Olives on the descent to Bethany,
is, to my mind, by far the most beautiful and impressive.
I halted every platoon there, so that all might look well
at the glory of it&mdash;a glory which, alas, some of them
would never again return to look upon.</p>

<p>We bivouacked about three miles beyond Jerusalem,
and next morning (13th August) marched through
Bethany while it was yet dark, and reached our bivouac
at Talaat ed Dumm at 2.30 in the afternoon. I reported
our arrival to General Chauvel, of the Australian
Mounted Division, whose headquarters were at this
place, and from his hut I had a splendid view of the
beauty and desolation of the Jordan Valley which lay
spread out before me.</p>

<p>Talaat ed Dumm is a weird uncanny spot. It is
mentioned in the Book of Joshua as Adummim, and is
the gate of the Judæan wilderness. The red and yellow
barren hills and rocky narrow valleys have a peculiar
desolation all their own, while the heat at the time we
were there was scorching.</p>

<p>By some jugglery on the part of the Staff, all our
transport animals had been taken away from us, and we
found ourselves stranded without a particle of shade,
shelter, or food on this God-forsaken spot, sweltering
in the fierce rays of the burning sun. At last, towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sundown, our baggage and rations arrived in motor
lorries, dinners and teas were rolled into one, and peace
reigned once more in this drowsy wilderness.</p>

<p>When the terrific heat had become somewhat less
scorching, accompanied by the Padre, I wandered up to
an ancient ruin which topped the summit of a hill
dominating the roadway. This proved to be the castle
of a redoubtable robber chief, who had lived here in
bygone days and taken his toll from every traveller.
From time immemorial this had been the stronghold of
the robber bands who waylaid, robbed, and even murdered
those journeying to and fro between Jerusalem and
Jericho. It was close to this bandit's castle that the
Good Samaritan poured oil and wine into the wounds of
the unfortunate wayfarer who had fallen among thieves.
It was an ideal spot for a robber's lair, because it commands
a full view of what is practically the only route
for caravans through this dreary barren wilderness.</p>

<p>We were not sorry to leave our camp at dawn, and
strode out so merrily that we overtook a Cavalry Brigade
which blocked our way! As we marched down the steep
descent to the Jordan Valley we had on our left the Wadi
Kelt, which wound its tortuous course through the
boulders at the bottom, hundreds of feet sheer below us.
Some people say that it was here that the Prophet Elijah
was fed by the ravens, but it has been satisfactorily
proved that the brook Cherith, where Elijah hid, is
now known as the Wadi Fusail. It runs into the
Jordan from the westward, near a place called the rock
of Oreb.</p>

<p>This suggested an idea to me that the "ravens"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
spoken of in the Bible were not birds but people, for the
word "Oreb" means a raven. Now we know there
was a prince called Oreb, for we have an account of his
death in Judges, Chapter 7, Verse 25. It is also a
well-known fact that in the East tribes take their names
from their prince or chief man, so that in all probability
there was a tribe called Orbim (the plural of "oreb"
or raven).</p>

<p>The place where Prince Oreb was slain was the rock
of Oreb, and it is known to this day as "Tel el Orbaim."
Moreover, this place is in Gilead, which was Elijah's
old home, so it was quite natural that he should flee to
this neighbourhood and be fed with flesh and bread,
night and morning, by his friends the Orbim, or
"Ravens."</p>

<p>How similar, too, are the words used in the 4th and
9th verses of 1st Kings, Chapter 17: "I have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there," and
"I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain
thee!"</p>

<p>Can it be possible that the ravens were people and
not birds, and that our old and learned translators fell
into the error of thinking that they were birds, because
they did not know of the possible existence of a tribe
called "Orbim" or "Ravens"?</p>

<p>We continued our march down through the Judæan
wilderness, the place where the High Priest yearly
turned loose the Scapegoat which bore on its head the
sins of the Children of Israel.</p>

<p>Occasionally, away to our right, between the desolate,
dusty, sulphurous-looking hills, we caught a momentary
glimpse of the emerald sheen of the Dead Sea, while
away on our left on the edge of the valley, stood out the
Mount of Temptation.</p>

<p>The moment we got down to the Jordan Valley (or
Ghor, as the Arabs call it) the real trials of the men
began. The heat was intense, and the going became
very heavy, for we had no longer a good metalled road
on which to march. Dust lay a foot deep on the path;
it was exceedingly fine and looked like the best powdered
cement. As the men marched clouds of it arose
and choked them, while their feet were actually sucked
down at each step, and an effort had to be made to draw
the foot out again, as if some devil were below, pulling
at the sole of the boot.</p>

<p>The sixteen platoons forming the battalion marched
well apart in order to evade as much of this blinding,
choking, sulphurous dust as possible.</p>

<p>Jericho, the city of the Palms, lay a little to our right.
We passed its outskirts and halted for a rest under Old
Jericho, the walls of which the Bible tells us miraculously
fell to Joshua's trumpets over 3,000 years ago. This
was a thought which acted as a spur to every Jewish
soldier, and although the march was a hard one and the
worst of it had yet to be done, the men came through
the ordeal triumphantly, and very few dropped out by
the way. Those who did fall by the wayside were helped
along by our Padre, the Rev. L. A. Falk, who gave up
his horse to the footsore and carried the pack and rifle
of the weary, thus cheering them along into Camp. This
time it was the Priest who proved the Good Samaritan on
the road to Jericho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after we recommenced our march from under the
walls of old Jericho a huge black column of fine dust,
whose top was lost in the Heavens, arose in front of us
and gyrated slowly and gracefully as our vanguard,
leading us onward to our bivouac on the banks of a cool
and pleasant brook, where it vanished. I felt that this
was a good omen for our success in the Jordan Valley,
for it was a case of the Children of Israel being led once
more by a pillar of cloud.</p>

<p>The Headquarters of the Australian Mounted Division
was close beside our bivouac, and here I had a very
welcome breakfast with Major-General H. W. Hodgson,
its capable and genial Commander. The General
told me that he would review the battalion on the following
afternoon, on its march out to the new camping
ground on the Auja.</p>

<p>Next morning, while the men were resting and refreshing
themselves on the banks of the Nueiameh
(for so the cool stream was named), I rode down the
Valley to the eastward of Jericho, accompanied by our
Padre.</p>

<p>We waded through the Wadi Kelt, luxuriant grass
growing where the water had overflowed its banks,
showing how fruitful the Valley would be if it were
irrigated. We searched the plain to discover, if possible,
some traces of the ancient Gilgal, Joshua's
G.H.Q., and eventually we came upon what we took
to be the site, some three miles to the south-east of Old
Jericho. At all events we found some very ancient
stonework buried in grass-grown mounds just about
where Gilgal might be looked for, and I feel sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
if excavations were carried out here some very interesting
discoveries would be made.</p>

<p>After we had briefly examined the ruins, I suggested
to the Padre that we should go and breakfast in Jericho,
if indeed we could find a caravanserai there, so in
search of a hostelry we rode into the modern city of
the Palms.</p>

<p>It proved to be but a poor tumble-down jumble of
buildings, as might have been expected. However, as
we rode along, we came upon a somewhat pretentious
looking building on which was painted "The Gilgal
Hotel." Whatever doubt there may have been about
the ancient Gilgal, here at any rate was a modern one,
the discovery of which at this moment was most opportune,
for we were both decidedly hungry after our
explorations.</p>

<p>As we rode into the courtyard a dozen Arab urchins
who had been lounging about made a dash for our
horses, each eager to grasp the reins in the hope of
some "baksheesh." An elderly dame, on hearing the
scuffle, emerged from a doorway, scattered the surplus
boys, and called loudly, "Victoria, Victoria." A
musical voice from a room above responded to this
familiar name, and, on looking up, we saw a buxom,
olive-tinted damsel step on to the balcony. A voluble
dialogue then took place between mother and daughter,
the result of which was that Victoria, in excellent
English, invited us up to breakfast. We had a most
sumptuous feast, or so it appeared to us, inured as we
were to plain Camp fare. I was particularly pleased
with the flavour of the honey, which Victoria informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me was taken from a hive in the garden. The milk,
too, was good and plentiful, so we had at last reached
the "land flowing with milk and honey."</p>

<p>Before we left, I asked our fair hostess how it came
about that she, a Syrian damsel, was known as
Victoria, to which she promptly replied, "Because I am
Queen of Jericho."</p>

<p>Some time afterwards I made a special visit to Old
Jericho. Naturally, during the 3,000 odd years that have
elapsed since its capture by Joshua, the old city has got
silted up and the place has been covered over by soil
washed down from the Judæan hills; but just before the
War a party of Antiquarians commenced excavation
work and exposed several buildings of the old city, some
twenty or thirty feet below the surface of the ground.
There the lintels and door-posts of wood may still be
seen embedded in the brickwork, but they are all turned
into charcoal, probably from the fire which consumed
the city by Joshua's command.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the rebuilding of Jericho
was forbidden under a terrible curse, "Cursed be the
man before the Lord that riseth up and buildeth this
city Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof in his
firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates
of it."</p>

<p>The Battalion left its pleasant bivouac by the
Nueiameh at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and waded
across through its cool waters; when we had marched
through the appalling dust of the Valley for some three
miles, I observed General Hodgson waiting to review
us on the far side of a steep nullah. I cantered on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
took my place beside the General and his A.D.C.,
Captain Buxton.</p>

<p>I am certain that a review was never held under more
peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>The men marched in column of fours, platoon after
platoon, down one side of the steep gully and up the
other, and then past the General, who apparently expected
to see them marching as steadily as if they had
been in the Long Valley at Aldershot; and the strange
part of it is that they <i>were</i> marching steadily, shoulder
to shoulder, in spite of the difficult ground which they
had to negotiate and the enormous load they had to
carry. They were one mass of dust from head to foot.
Nothing could be seen of their faces except a pair of
eyes blinking out of a countenance which looked as if it
had been dipped in a flour barrel and then streaked with
lines of soot, for rivulets of black sweat ran in parallel
lines down their dust-covered faces.</p>

<p>It was the funniest sight I ever saw in my life, but the
men were as grave as owls. I could hardly keep my
face straight when, on the command "eyes left" being
given, they turned their comical looking faces boldly up
to the General!</p>

<p>I remarked to him that it was a bit of an ordeal to
review them just after scrambling down and up the steep
sides of a gully, and he replied, "That is exactly why
I am here. I want to see how they shape under the
most difficult possible circumstances, and I must congratulate
you on their soldierly bearing and steadiness."</p>

<p>The Battalion certainly did itself credit that day, for
it was no light ordeal to go through, considering the dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and heat, and the enormous weight that the unfortunate
men had to carry stowed away on every part of the
person.</p>

<p>When we had completed about six miles of the march
towards our camping place at the Auja, we were met by
the Brigade Major of the 12th Cavalry Brigade, an
energetic Staff Officer, who, besides coming himself,
had thoughtfully provided guides to lead us into the
Camp in the darkness. It must be remembered that
we were now within sight and range of the Turkish
guns, and all large bodies of troops had to move in the
dark. We were very glad to reach our bivouac on the
Auja, which is a pleasant, swiftly-flowing streamlet,
with many cool and shady nooks amid the foliage which
grows in profusion along its banks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Our Position in the Mellahah.</span></div>


<p>We were now attached to the 12th Cavalry Brigade,
commanded by Brigadier-General J. T. Wigan,
and on the 16th, 17th, and 18th August we took over
D and E sections of the Desert Corps front line, relieving
the 19th Indian Lancers and the 6th Indian Cavalry
Regiments. We were unfortunately only a few days
with the 12th Brigade, which was moved to Ludd soon
after we were posted to it.</p>

<p>The Jordan Valley, at the place where we were entrenched,
is about fifteen miles wide and is over 1,200
feet below sea level. It is for the most part fairly flat,
but is intersected here and there by huge ravines, which
are in places quite narrow, and at others some hundreds
of yards across, with sheer cliffs some thirty to fifty feet
high as banks. Looking at the valley from the hills
that border it, one would never suspect the existence of
these great rifts. The River Jordan runs in the centre
of one of these depressions, which in places is 50 to 100
feet below the ordinary level of the rest of the valley.</p>

<p>The Wadi Mellahah is another huge cleft or rift, running
about a mile to the west of, and more or less parallel
to, the Jordan. It is some 10 miles long, and varies
from a few score yards to a mile in width. Steep cliffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and slopes shut it in on both sides, and make the bed of
the Mellahah about as hot and stifling a spot as can well
be imagined, while, to add further abomination to it,
noxious fumes arose in places from its barren and desolate
looking sides and bed. A tiny, briny streamlet runs
its straggling course through it in the dry season, although
in places it spreads out into large reed-covered
swamps. The water of this rivulet was so salt that a
single drop was more than one could bear to take on the
tip of one's tongue.</p>

<p>We made our headquarters in this gully some three
miles from where it flows into the Auja, of which it is a
tributary, and here we fixed up a reed hut as our mess
house, under the shade of the only tree in this depressing
spot. Of course we had to keep down in the depths of
the ravine, otherwise we would be seen and shelled by
the Turks.</p>

<p>This Mellahah Wadi had been made in the course of
ages by the rush of water coming down from the Judæan
range and from other hills to the north where there is a
heavy annual rainfall. Here and there in the ravine,
where it is at its broadest, stand isolated hillocks which
the water has not worn away, and on these had been constructed
some of our more northern redoubts; they were
easy to defend and commanded a good view, for their
tops were on a level with the surface of the surrounding
valley.</p>

<p>One of our redoubts was named "Salt," and just to
the north of it a sparkling spring bubbled out of the side
of the cliff. It looked so pure and inviting that I took a
mouthful, and was nearly poisoned for my pains. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was the most briny, sulphurous liquid imaginable. There
is a fortune awaiting the man who exploits its medicinal
properties!</p>

<p>The northern end of the Mellahah was held by the
Turks, and there it opened out into a huge swamp. Of
course the mosquitoes bred and thrived in this natural
reserve, and played havoc, not only with the Turkish
Army, but with our men too; when the wind blew from
the north it carried the little demons amongst us in
swarms. We had drained the swampy part of the Mellahah
within our own lines at enormous pains, so that
unless the wind blew from the north, we were fairly free
of the irritating pests.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we used to go out every night half
a mile or so in front of our wire, deepening and diverting
the streamlet, in order to dry up the swamp and remove
the breeding ground of the mosquitoes as far as possible
from our posts. This was always risky work, for, if
the Turks had discovered what we were about, they
would no doubt have made it very lively for us with rifle
and machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>From a military point of view our position in the Mellahah
was a hazardous one.</p>

<p>We were now on the extreme right flank and extreme
north front of the British Army in Palestine&mdash;the post
of honour and danger in the line, with the Turks practically
on three sides of us in the salient which we held.
We had the most exposed piece of front to guard which
it is possible to conceive, and we were so badly supported
by guns, etc., that, had the Turks made a determined
attack in force, we would probably have been annihilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
before succour could reach us. It was altogether an
extraordinarily risky position in which to place a raw battalion.
The authorities must have had great faith in
our fighting abilities.</p>

<p>We were the only troops in the Mellahah, or within
miles of it, our next nearest neighbours being the West
Indian Regiment, which had a much better position than
ours, close under the Judæan hills, with the swift sweet
waters of the Auja running through their lines.</p>

<p>The 20th Indian Infantry Brigade held the Jordan
some three miles to the south of us, and it would have
been quite feasible for the Turks to have concentrated
a considerable force and thrust themselves into the gap
between our lines and theirs, and by so doing we would
have been completely cut off.</p>

<p>The Anzac Mounted Division was strung out a long
way southward, from the Auja to the Dead Sea, and
some considerable time would have to elapse before these
doughty warriors could come to our assistance. The
guns guarding our section of the front were very few&mdash;about
six 13-pounders and a couple of howitzers, the
latter being rarely brought into action.</p>

<p>We had in our neighbourhood part of the 4th Turkish
Army, some 10,000 strong, with over 70 guns, so it can
be seen how precarious our position was. In our infant
days some wag had bestowed upon us the unofficial
motto of "No advance without security," but here we
did not live up to it, for we were indeed well advanced
without any security.</p>

<p>The Turks were in possession of the important Umm
esh Shert Ford on the Jordan, and held very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
positions covering the ford on our side of the river, and
their entrenched line ran right across our front and
onward to the Judæan foothills, some ten miles to the
west of our position.</p>

<p>To the southward of the Umm esh Shert Ford we had
an observation post on the cliffs which overlooked the
Jordan, and on a moonlight night it was an eerie experience
to stroll across to it and lie on the warm sand,
listening to the melancholy howling of the jackals and
hyenas which filled the air with their dismal cries and
wailings. I often wondered if the thick growth of
tangled trees and shrubs which spread out over 100 feet
below me up and down the river banks did not conceal
many strange wild creatures, still unsuspected in these
regions; the place lends itself to the weird in all things,
but the only uncanny thing I saw there was a reddish
coloured hare with enormous ears, which, on that
occasion at all events, got away safely to the shelter of
the reeds.</p>

<p>The Turkish outposts at this point were established
on the opposite bank of the Jordan, but they never
molested us, or attempted to cross at this point.</p>

<p>Our sector of some seven miles of front stretched from
this point in a north-westerly direction, and we held a
series of redoubts, some on the Jordan bank of the Wadi
Mellahah, others on hillocks in the ravine, as I have
already described, and three more on the right bank of
the Wadi.</p>

<p>This sector was divided into two. I placed Major
Ripley in command of the north-western part, while
Major Neill commanded the south-eastern wing. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of these officers had some six redoubts to defend, and
several of the posts were quite isolated and had to
depend entirely on themselves in case of attack.</p>

<p>I recommended that two of these posts should be
abolished, for they were unsuitable for defence purposes.
The Corps Commander (General Chauvel), the Divisional
Commander, and all their staffs came out one day
to see if my suggestion was sound. I remember we all
stood in a row looking over one of the parapets of the
useless redoubt in full view of the Turks; if they had only
fired a lucky shot from "Jericho Jane" that morning
they might have made a good bag!</p>

<p>All the generals agreed that the two posts were useless,
so we dismantled them gladly, for it meant less
men to find for duty each night&mdash;a most important consideration
when one's men are all too few for the work
in hand.</p>

<p>This was the last I saw of General Chauvel and
General Hodgson, for they were soon afterwards
ordered out of the Valley to prepare for the great concentration
which was being secretly carried out on the
extreme left of the Army near Jaffa. When the
Australian Division was removed we were attached to
Major-General Sir Edward Chaytor, who commanded
the Anzac Mounted Division of immortal fame. This
was a piece of rare good fortune for us, for we found in
General Chaytor a man of wide sympathy and understanding,
a demon for work and efficiency, but always
ready to give honour where honour was due&mdash;even unto
Jews.</p>

<p>Although our position in the Mellahah was such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
isolated and precarious one, we had no pessimistic forebodings
with regard to our ability to give a good account
of ourselves if attacked. We felt that "the greater the
danger, the greater the honour," and it behoved us to be
all the more vigilant, and up and doing at all times.</p>

<p>The magnificent way in which the men responded to
the call of duty in that desolate, nerve-racking region,
is beyond all praise. All day long the sun beat down
mercilessly on them, their only shelter being a flimsy
bit of bivouac canvas, and the nights were stifling. Perspiration
streamed from every pore, even when resting.
Flies and mosquitoes deprived everyone of sleep, for our
mosquito nets soon became torn and worthless, and could
not be replaced.</p>

<p>Just before dark every available man other than those
required to go on patrols and reconnoitring duty had to
parade fully equipped and march to his post on the
redoubts. Here the apparently endless night was spent.
At dawn the men marched back to their comfortless
bivouacs to snatch what repose they could before they
were again called upon to work on strengthening the
redoubts and deepening the trenches.</p>

<p>It was in truth an exceedingly strenuous life under
such terrible climatic conditions.</p>

<p>Water could only be obtained in very limited quantities;
every drop had to be carried from the Auja four
or five miles away. The whole place was constantly
enveloped in stagnant dust, so it can be imagined with
what appetite a man could tackle food under such
appalling conditions, every mouthful of which was
necessarily full of sand and grit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>An Australian summed up life in the Jordan Valley
very well, when he remarked one sweltering day, "God
need not have troubled to make Hell when He had the
Jordan Valley."</p>

<p>This part of the Jordan Valley is not supposed to be
habitable during the months of August and September.
Even the wild Bedouins, who linger in these parts to
feed their flocks of goats, flee from the accursed place
in these two dreaded months.</p>

<p>No British soldier had yet been called upon to endure
the horrors of the Mellahah even for a week; nevertheless
the Jewish Battalion was kept there for over seven
weeks at the most deadly period of the year. Looking
back upon it all I can only say that the Jewish people
may well be proud of their Battalion for the admirable
way it "carried on" in this abomination of desolation.
It was about the hottest, most unhealthy, and most God-forsaken
place in the universe&mdash;in fact some of my men
assured me that they saw the Devil himself there, horns,
tail and all!</p>

<p>Such was the position allotted to the 38th Battalion to
defend and hold, and it can be imagined that the change
from the hill tops of Ephraim to this inferno was
appalling.</p>

<p>Knowing that our enemies had already tried to abolish
the Jewish Battalion, I was strongly reminded of the
story of Uriah the Hittite!</p>

<p>How terribly we suffered owing to our tour of duty in
this pestilential region will be described in a later
chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Life in Mellahah.</span></div>


<p>Although the climatic change from the cool
hill-tops of Samaria to the inferno of the Jordan
Valley differed as does Heaven from Hell, still we had
compensations in the fair, just, and kindly treatment
meted out to us by General Chaytor and every officer,
non-commissioned officer, and man of the Anzac
Mounted Division.</p>

<p>The battalion stood entirely on its merits, and that it
found favour in the sight of these famous fighters is the
proudest feather in its cap. Their minds were as broad
as the wide spaces from whence they had come, and in
their strong souls there was no room for petty spite or
discrimination. If we quitted ourselves like men and
performed our duties like good soldiers, then it did not
matter, even if we were Jews.</p>

<p>The Anzac Mounted Division Headquarters were
about eight miles from my own, and it frequently fell to
my lot to ride there through the devouring heat of the
day for a conference with the General. Never shall I forget
the delicious cool draught of shandy that always welcomed
me, straight from the ice-box, mixed by the
cunning hand of Colonel Bruxner, the A.A. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Q.M.G. of the Division. Bruxner would spy me from
afar off, and, being a man of understanding, had the
nectar all ready by the time I reached his tent, and oh,
how good it was! No place in the world can raise a
thirst like the Jordan Valley, but it was almost worth
enduring when it could be quenched by a long draught
of Bruxner's elixir.</p>

<p>The principal objective on our special piece of front
was the Umm esh Shert Ford over the Jordan. It was
some two miles to the East of our most northerly posts
on the Mellahah, and it was well protected by a series
of trenches, by barbed wire entanglements, and by the
fortified Jordan cliffs. If we could, by any chance, get
possession of this crossing, it would mean that the
Turkish communications would be thrown considerably
out of gear, and all their local arrangements East and
West of the Jordan completely upset.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the case of an advance on our part,
by pushing mounted troops across this Ford, the whole
of the Turkish position, ten miles to the East-South-East
of us at Nimrin, would be turned, for the road by
the Umm esh Shert Ford was the short cut to Es Salt
(the old Ramoth Gilead) and Amman (the ancient Rabbath
Ammon, where that splendid Hittite soldier Uriah
was treacherously sent to his death).</p>

<p>Our constant endeavour, therefore, in patrol and reconnaissance,
was to gather all possible information as to
the ways and means of getting at this spot and making
it our own. No stone was left unturned and no risk
avoided which would lead to this important result, and
in due course we had our reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In such an isolated position as ours, the only thing to
be done was to adopt an aggressive attitude towards our
enemies and so induce them to think that we were a
great deal stronger than was actually the case. This
policy succeeded admirably, and we put up such a good
bluff, and harried the Turks so vigorously, that they
were in constant dread of attack, and immediately began
to erect barbed wire fences right along their entire front,
with every appearance of haste and nervousness.</p>

<p>Considering the nature and extent of the position
which we held, we lost very few men in killed, wounded,
and missing during the seven odd weeks we grilled in the
Jordan Valley. We were daily and nightly shelled, but
the Turkish gunners rarely had any luck. On the other
hand we harassed them continuously, with the result that
deserters began to come in freely, sometimes singly, and
often in twos and threes. It is strange, but true, that
until we came into the valley, prisoners and deserters
were very scarce.</p>

<p>On one occasion a prisoner was brought before me
trembling violently. On asking him what was the
matter, he replied that he feared his throat was about to
be cut! His officer, he said, had told him that we finished
off all our prisoners in this way. I laughed, and (wishing
to prove him) told him that after he had had some
food I proposed to send him back to his camp so that
he might tell all his comrades how well we treated those
who fell into our hands. On hearing this he cried
bitterly that he did not want to return to his camp at any
price, and begged to be kept by the British, a request
to which I of course readily acceded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>A Turkish sergeant who was captured one day made
us all laugh heartily. Before he was marched off to the
prisoners' compound somebody wanted to take a photo
of him. The little sergeant (for he was quite diminutive)
preened himself like a peacock, gave a rakish tilt
to his headgear, a fierce twist to his moustache, and
struck a dramatic pose before he would allow himself
to be snapped. He was a regular Turkish Charley
Chaplin!</p>

<p>Most of our prisoners told us quite frankly that they
were tired of the war, their ill usage, and bad food, and
were glad to be in our hands, more especially as they
never got any rest in front of our lines.</p>

<p>On the 26th August thirteen Turks of the 1st Infantry
Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 24th Division surrendered.
These men deserted <i>en bloc</i> while they were
holding a post which guarded the flank of their battalion.
I found out from them that their relief party was due to
arrive before I could possibly get a half platoon from my
battalion to occupy the deserted post. If time had
allowed me to lay a little trap, I should like to have seen
the faces of the incoming Turks when they found themselves
looking down our rifle barrels as they marched
into their post. They must have been sufficiently
astonished as it was to find the place empty.</p>

<p>I watched an exciting little adventure one morning as
I stood in one of the fire bays of our most advanced
redoubt, just as dawn was breaking, peering through my
field glasses to the northward, along the jagged course
of the Mellahah where it spread out into many channels
and ravines near the Turkish lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once I spied, some 800 yards off, two Turkish
officers standing at the foot of a huge sand slope, gazing
at something away to their left. They looked to me as
if they had come out to shoot a hare, or perhaps a
gazelle, as there were some of these pretty creatures in
the Valley. One of the officers was extremely tall and
wore a long black cloak.</p>

<p>Now I knew that I had an officer (Lieutenant Evans)
and man out scouting in that neighbourhood, and I felt
rather anxious for their safety if they should, unexpectedly,
come upon the Turks. I therefore searched
the vicinity with my glasses, and sure enough, there they
were walking calmly along on the opposite side of the
high sand bank under which the Turks were standing.
Neither party was aware of the presence of the
other. I felt it was not a time to take any chances, for
I did not know how many more Turks there might be
concealed from my view behind the many sand hills
that were dotted about, so I called up Major Ripley
and sent him and half-a-dozen men at the double, to
cause a diversion, and, if possible, to capture the enemy
officers.</p>

<p>While giving these directions I kept my glasses on
my two scouts, hoping that a lucky turn would take them
out of danger, or expose the enemy to them before they
themselves were spotted. All at once Lieutenant Evans
headed up the side of the sand ridge, and I knew then
that all would be well, for the Turks had their backs to
him. As soon as he reached the top he cautiously
peered over, and he must have been astonished to see
the enemy so near, for he promptly ducked his head out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of view. He then slid down the slope, took his orderly
with him, and ran to put himself between the Turks and
their lines, hoping, I suppose, to ambush them as they
returned. The latter, all unconscious of what was going
on, were taking things very casually, and instead of
going back to camp, they came on a little way in the
direction of our lines. This upset Evans' calculations,
so he and his man began to stalk the Turks, and just
as he was about to open fire on them they discovered
him, and then both sides loosed off their rifles and a
regular duel began.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Major Ripley and his men had climbed
half-way up the side of the ravine, and they in turn
began to blaze away at the Turks, who were now
thoroughly scared. They took to flight, and in the
many twists, turns and channels thereabouts managed
to get safely away to their own lines.</p>

<p>Evans and his scout got back to ours, none the worse
for their adventure.</p>

<p>I had a narrow shave myself in this same post a couple
of days later. It was my custom to scan the enemy's
lines soon after daybreak every morning from this commanding
position in order to see if any changes had taken
place in the night. A Turkish sniper must have seen
me and marked me for his own. At all events I had
just finished my survey, and stepped down from my
perch, when a bullet buried itself with a thud in the bank
just where my head had been!</p>

<p>A couple of days later Lieutenant Mendes and
Sergeant Levy were out scouting along the intricate
course of the Mellahah, to the north of our lines, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
they walked into an ambuscade; the Sergeant fell at the
first volley, but luckily Mendes was not hit. He refused
to surrender, and, in spite of some fleet-footed Turks
making the pace very hot for him, he eluded the lot and
got back to our lines safely, but thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">We Win Our First Honours.</span></div>


<p>On the 28th August a patrol of six privates, under
the command of a sergeant, crept up to the
Turkish trenches near the Umm esh Shert Ford. It
was a dark and windy night, so they got quite close to
the enemy without being seen. When about thirty yards
short of the Turks they lay down and then observed a
sentry standing a little way off. One of the patrol,
Private Sapieshvili, a Jew from the Caucasus, began to
crawl forward and cautiously stalk the unwary sentinel.
When eventually he succeeded in getting behind him,
he stood up and advanced boldly, pretending to be a
Turk, for he was able to speak a few words of Turkish.
All at once he pounced on the sentry, seized him by the
throat and bore him to the ground.</p>

<p>The enemy in the trenches heard the scuffle and
opened fire and one man of our patrol was badly hit.
Sapieshvili, however, stuck to his prisoner, disarmed
him and took him triumphantly off to our camp. The
Turks in the trenches numbered about a score, and kept
up a heavy fire, so the rest of the patrol withdrew. Before
doing so, Private Gordon lifted his wounded comrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
(Private Marks) and carried him back to our lines
under a rain of bullets from the Turks.</p>

<p>I recommended these men to General Chaytor for
their gallantry and coolness under fire.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that Private Marks' wound proved
to be a mortal one. He had only joined the battalion
some three days previously, and this was his first encounter
with the Turks. He had served in France and
other war centres, and had passed through many a fierce
fight scathless.</p>

<p>We gave him a very impressive burial the following
morning, under the lea of a little hillock, with his face
turned towards Jerusalem; the spires of the buildings on
the Mount of Olives could actually be seen from the spot
where we were standing around his grave.</p>

<p>One of the ten men who, at Helmieh, had wished to
join a Labour battalion, but who, on reconsideration,
had seen that it was his duty to remain as a fighting
soldier, was Private Greyman. He was a man who
disapproved of all forms of violence. He hated war
and all the brutalities pertaining thereto, yet he carried
out his military duties most conscientiously. He
happened to be one of a party on duty in the forward
trenches on the Day of Atonement, and while repelling
some snipers who were attempting to make it unpleasant
for us in our camp, poor Greyman met with an
instantaneous death, an enemy bullet passing through
his head. I heard afterwards that when his widow
received the usual War Office notification that he was
killed in action, she refused to believe it, for she saw that
the date given was the Day of Atonement, a day on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which she said no Jew could possibly be fighting; but
alas, we had to man the trenches continuously, no matter
how sacred or in what reverence any particular day was
held by Jew or Gentile.</p>

<p>We were sometimes attached to the 1st and sometimes
to the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigades under
Generals Cox and Ryrie; when they moved we were
placed under General Meldrum, the Commander of the
New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. All were keen
soldiers and good and gallant comrades.</p>

<p>While we were under General Ryrie I remember he
said to me one day that he would like to come out and
inspect my posts.</p>

<p>"Very good, General," I said. "Come out with me
any morning you wish."</p>

<p>"When do you start?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Generally at 3 a.m.," I replied.</p>

<p>"That's a d&mdash;d good time to sleep," said the
General.</p>

<p>Another night some of our patrols scared the Turks
badly, and they started a tremendous fusillade with every
rifle and gun that could be brought into action. The
noise of the battle reverberated down the Mellahah and
reached the Auja, where General Ryrie was encamped.
Thinking that a serious attack had begun, the General
sprang hastily out of bed and planted his naked
foot right on to the tail of a huge black scorpion. For
a full half-hour afterwards Australia was heard at her
best.</p>

<p>When I saw him a couple of days later he philosophically
remarked that there was virtue even in a scorpion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sting, for it had completely cured him of ever
attempting to get out of bed again in the dark, even if
all the Turks in the Ottoman Empire were at his door.</p>

<p>General Ryrie, afterwards promoted to Major-General,
was appointed to the command of the Australian
Mounted Division, and had the K.C.M.G.
conferred on him.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August General Allenby reviewed
the Anzacs at their Headquarters, some four miles to
the north of Jericho. The Mounted Division was
formed into three sides of a square, and into this General
Allenby galloped, followed by his Staff. It was well for
the Commander-in-Chief that he was a good horseman,
for the spirited animal which he rode gave one or two
very hearty bucks, quite enough to have unseated the
majority of our Generals.</p>

<p>Later, the Chief decorated a number of the officers
and men who had gallantly won distinctions, and at the
end of the ceremony made a good soldierly speech to the
Division.</p>

<p>I was invited to be present at the review, and on being
presented by General Chaytor to the Commander-in-Chief
the latter remarked, "Oh, by the way, Patterson,
I fear I cannot form your Jewish Brigade, for I have
been notified by the War Office that there are no more
Jewish troops coming out." I replied that I thought
this information must be inaccurate, for I had just had
a letter from the officer commanding the 40th Battalion at
Plymouth, informing me that he was about to embark
with his battalion for service in Palestine. The Commander-in-Chief
seemed somewhat surprised on hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
this, but remarked that he considered his information
later and better than mine, so of course there was nothing
more to be said.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, on 30th August, General
Chaytor had a conference with all his Brigade and Infantry
Commanders, and as he had heard General
Allenby saying to me that he considered his information
with regard to Jewish reinforcements better than mine,
he remarked: "Well, Patterson, your information
about the coming of the other Jewish Battalions
was better than the Chief's after all, for one of
my officers has just come from England, and he tells
me that a strong Jewish Battalion came out with him
in the same ship and landed in Egypt a couple of days
ago."</p>

<p>As I considered it only right to let the Commander-in-Chief
know that the information he had received was not
accurate, I wrote and told him that I understood that
another Jewish Battalion, some 1,400 strong, had
already arrived in Egypt.</p>

<p>In reply to this I got a memorandum from the Chief
of Staff, Major-General Louis Jean Bols, intimating that
in future I was only to address the Commander-in-Chief
through the ordinary channels of communication.</p>

<p>It was evident from this that the Chief of Staff was
not pleased that the Commander-in-Chief should have
any sidelight from me on Jewish affairs. Of course
this had long been apparent, for anything I had previously
written through the ordinary channels&mdash;no
matter how important to the welfare of the battalion&mdash;had
invariably been returned to me with the remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that it was not considered necessary to refer the matter
further.</p>

<p>Some months after my interview with the Commander-in-Chief
yet another thousand men arrived from
England, and altogether there were over five thousand
Jewish soldiers serving in the Jewish units in Palestine.
The formation of a Jewish Brigade had been the definite
policy of the War Office, and an intimation to this effect
had been sent to General Allenby. The Commander-in-Chief
of the E.E.F. had himself written to me to
say that a Jewish Brigade would be formed, yet this
promise, which meant so much to the comfort and
efficiency of the men and to the prestige of Jews the
world over, was never fulfilled; instead, we were pushed
about from Brigade to Brigade and from Division to
Division in the most heart-breaking manner, with the
result that we got all the kicks and none of the traditional
halfpence!</p>

<p>In the space of three months we were shunted about
like so many cattle trucks and found ourselves, in that
brief period, attached to no less than twelve different
formations of the British Army!</p>

<p>General Chaytor gave a great lift to the spirit of the
battalion when he conferred the Military Medal on Privates
Sapieshvili and Gordon for their gallant conduct on the
night patrol already mentioned. We had a special
parade in "Salt" post redoubt, after Divine Service on
the first day of the Jewish New Year (7th September,
1918). Before all their comrades the General recounted
their gallant deeds, pinned the coveted ribbons on their
breasts, and then ordered the battalion to march past and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
salute&mdash;not himself, but the two men whom he had just
decorated. From this moment General Chaytor had
with him the heartfelt devotion of every man in the unit.
A small thing can win the respect, goodwill, and devotion
of a Regiment, but it is not every General who has
the knack of gaining it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Capture of the Umm esh Shert Ford.</span></div>


<p>As the date fixed for the great advance of the Army
in Palestine drew near, certain parts of the
Jordan Valley began to look very comical. Here and
there would be seen a battery of artillery parked, or a
cavalry regiment, with its horses tethered in neat and
orderly array, in the most approved army style, but on
closer inspection both horses and guns were found to be
merely dummies! Great camps were pitched, but there
was not a soldier in them; fires were lighted all over the
place at dusk, as if a mighty army were bivouacked round
about, and every conceivable kind of bluff was put up in
order to deceive the Turks and make them think that
the long expected attack was to be made through
Gilead, to effect a junction with the Arab Army of the
Hedjaz. The Jewish Battalion was even ordered to
march and counter march from Jericho to the Dead Sea
by some wight at G.H.Q. who still remembered us, but
General Chaytor scotched this stunt, for of course he
knew it was quite impossible for us to guard our front
throughout the night and march some forty miles by
day as well in that terrific heat.</p>

<p>There were really very few troops in the Valley, if
one considers the enemy force that could have been concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
against us. According to General Allenby's
despatch, there were some 6,000 rifles, 2,000 sabres,
and 74 guns facing us in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>General Allenby in his despatch of the 31st October,
1918, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"By reducing the strength of the troops in the Jordan
Valley to a minimum," etc., and "To prevent the decrease
in strength in the Jordan Valley being discovered
by the enemy I ordered Major General Sir Edward
Chaytor, K.C.M.G., C.B., A.D.C., to carry out with
the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, the
20th Indian (Imperial Service) Infantry Brigade, the
38th and 39th Battalions of the Royal Fusiliers, and
the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment
a series of demonstrations with the object of
inducing the enemy to believe that an attack East of
the Jordan was intended, either in the direction of
Madeba or Amman.</p>

<p>"The enemy was thought to be anticipating an attack
in these directions and every possible step was taken to
strengthen his suspicions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 15th September the 39th Battalion Royal
Fusiliers, under the command of Colonel Margolin,
D.S.O., arrived in the Jordan Valley, and took up its
position on the Auja in support of the 38th Battalion in
the line.</p>

<p>A couple of days before the big offensive which began
on the 18th September, General Allenby visited my
Headquarters, where I presented to him all the officers
not on duty. He took me a little apart and asked me if I
was sure I could trust the men to fight, and I assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
him that he need have no anxiety on that score, for the
men were all right and would respond to any call when
it was made.</p>

<p>He then asked me if there was any other point I
should like to bring to his notice: I told him that malaria
was daily becoming more prevalent and I was losing
200 men a week from this cause alone: I also pointed
out that I did not think that the medical arrangements
for the evacuation and care of the men were all that they
should be. The General made a note of this in his
book.</p>

<p>The only result was that I got an irate letter from the
Deputy Adjutant-General asking me for a full report as
to why I had misinformed the Commander-in-Chief
about my sick, and about medical matters generally, so
that on the morning of the 23rd September, the day we
were ordered to pursue the enemy, when I should have
been solely devoted to the leading of my men and all the
problems pertaining thereto, I had to sit down and
smooth the ruffled feathers of the Deputy Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>I not only proved my case to the hilt, but emphasized
it by giving further evidence which I had not troubled
the Commander-in-Chief by recounting.</p>

<p>General Chaytor specially warned us that, during the
offensive on our left, we were to increase our patrols and
harry the enemy as much as possible, to keep him in his
lines and to prevent, if possible, any large force of
Turks crossing from the East of the Jordan to reinforce
their armies holding the line from the Jordan to the sea.</p>

<p>This is how the official report runs:&mdash;"Chaytor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
force in the Jordan Valley had so far confined itself to
vigorous patrolling to insure that the enemy could make
no move without their knowledge. The rôle of this
composite force was to secure the right flank of the army
and the Jordan crossings, to keep in close touch with
the enemy and take advantage of any withdrawal on
their part, but to run no risk of being involved with a
more powerful foe too early in the battle. This difficult
task was admirably carried out."</p>

<p>During the nights of the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st
September we made demonstrations against the
Turkish positions along our front. Parties would crawl
out into favourable positions, such as a fold in the
ground, and open fire all down the line. This always
made the Turks nervy, and their trenches would be
manned and every individual would blaze away for all
he was worth.</p>

<p>On the 19th and 20th they got so "windy" that they
called on their artillery to put down a barrage to prevent
us from making an assault. Each time the barrage was
put down our men were well clear, and lay snug and
safe until the enemy had uselessly expended hundreds
of rounds, when they quietly returned to camp, not a whit
the worse for all the cannonading. There was very
little sleep on these nights for anyone, and the Jewish
Battalion certainly did all that in it lay to further the intentions
of the Commander-in-Chief by holding every
Turk in the neighbourhood of the Jordan closely to his
lines.</p>

<p>On the 20th we pushed well up against the Turkish
trenches, found them all manned, and again drew heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire. We had a few
men wounded in this affair. Why we had not a heavy
casualty list on these occasions is a mystery to me, for
the men had to advance in the open over a stretch of
ground as level as a billiard table.</p>

<p>Number 6 Trench Mortar Battery R.A. was under
my command in the Mellahah, and I ordered this battery
to open fire on the Turkish position round Umm esh
Shert, if we should find difficulty in ousting the enemy
from this important place.</p>

<p>I had arranged to attack this position on the 22nd
September, but at midnight on the 21st my Intelligence
Officer sent me news that the enemy's resistance in the
trenches opposite Umm esh Shert Ford was weakening.</p>

<p>I immediately ordered out my reserve, and sent them
under Lieutenant Cross to reinforce Major Neill, whose
duty it was to push in the Turks and take the Ford at
the earliest possible moment. I got favourable news
by telephone of the steady advance of the men; trench
after trench was occupied, and when I left my Headquarters
at 4 a.m. for the scene of the fight, I was able
to report to General Chaytor's Staff Officer that we were
almost in possession of the crossing.</p>

<p>I galloped off as dawn was breaking, scrambled up the
cliffs and across the ground from which the Turks had
fled, and arrived in time to go down with Major Neill,
Captain Julian, and Lieutenants Jabotinsky and Cross,
to take possession of this coveted passage over the
Jordan. I may mention here that Jabotinsky had been
attached to G.H.Q. for special work, but, as soon as the
battalion went into the line, he requested to be returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to duty in order to share in all our dangers and
hardships.</p>

<p>The moment we had secured the Umm esh Shert
Ford I signalled the news to General Chaytor, who immediately
took advantage of our capture by pushing
mounted troops across the Jordan, thus outflanking the
Turks who held the foothills of Shunat Nimrin, which
barred the way to Es Salt.</p>

<p>The 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade crossed
while we covered the Ford with our rifles and machine-guns,
and they never drew rein until Es Salt was reached
that evening, where a large force of the enemy with
guns, etc., was captured by the Anzac Mounted
Division.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, two companies of the 39th Battalion
Royal Fusiliers moved up to our support and took
up position in the posts which we had vacated in the
Mellahah.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the whole movement of the
British Army in Palestine, which swept the Turks out
of the country, was actually pivoted on the sons of
Israel, who were once again fighting the enemy, not far
from the spot where their forefathers had crossed the
Jordan under Joshua.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lost Transport Wagons.</span></div>


<p>Meanwhile I was ordered to clear away the
enemy believed to be still holding the ground
to the north of our trenches round Red Hill. I detailed
Captain H. H. Harris and his Company for this duty,
the remainder of the battalion taking up position in the
vacated Turkish trenches overlooking the Jordan.
Lieutenant Jabotinsky, with his platoon, took possession
of Umm esh Shert and put the captured ford in a state
of defence, making machine-gun emplacements, etc., to
cover the crossing.</p>

<p>I myself with Captain Julian, Lieutenant Cross, and
a platoon reconnoitred up the river, for I had heard that
there was a bridge in existence, which had been thrown
across by the Turks in the neighbourhood of the ford,
and I was anxious to find it if possible. After going
some little way I found it was nearly 8 o'clock a.m., and
time to be getting back to my Battalion Headquarters,
so I left Julian, Cross, and the patrol to push on and
make what discoveries they could along the river. When
I got back to my tent I found a telegram awaiting me
from General Chaytor which informed me that I had
been given command of a body of troops to be known
officially as "Patterson's Column." It was composed
of the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, and was
ordered to concentrate on the Auja bridgehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>I handed over command of the 38th to Major Ripley,
who was the next Senior Officer, and issued the necessary
concentration orders.</p>

<p>Later on I rode out to view the position which we had
wrested from the Turks on the Jordan and, on the way,
I was surprised to meet Captain Julian being brought
in wounded on a camel. He was in considerable pain,
but quite cheery and able to give me a full account of
what had happened. It seems that soon after I had
left them the party was ambushed by the Turks, who
caught them, in the neighbourhood of Red Hill, with
machine-gun and rifle fire. Julian, Cross, and Private
Mildemer fell; the remainder of the patrol melted into
a fold of the ground and made their escape. Julian,
although severely wounded in the foot, also managed to
get away, aided by Corporal Elfman, who gallantly
helped him to safety, although under heavy fire from
the enemy.</p>

<p>Reinforcements had been sent out as quickly as possible
to the scene of the fight by the nearest Company,
but by the time they arrived the Turks had gone. No
trace could be found of Lieutenant Cross's body, but
Private Mildemer was found lying dead where he fell.</p>

<p>On receipt of this news I sent another party under
Lieutenant Bullock to give burial according to Jewish
rites to the gallant man who had fallen, and to make a
thorough search of the locality for Lieutenant Cross's
body, but no trace of the missing officer could be found.
Telegrams were dispatched to the hospitals at Amman,
Deraa, and to Damascus after we had captured that city,
but nothing was known of him at any of these places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and in the end we all came to the sad conclusion that we
had seen the last of poor Cross and that the Turks must
have thrown his body into the Jordan after he had died
from his wounds. His loss cast a gloom over the
battalion.</p>

<p>I was also exceedingly sorry to be deprived of Captain
Julian's services with the transport, just at the moment
when we were ordered to start off in pursuit of the enemy,
for he was an ideal Transport Officer, and never once let
the battalion down while he served in that capacity, and
he had held this important position from the day he
joined us.</p>

<p>It was not long until we had a sharp reminder of his
loss, for that same evening our transport trekked off and
could not be found anywhere. Someone (I never could
discover who) gave the Transport Sergeant orders to
leave his lines on the Auja and report, with all wagons,
etc., to Major Ripley in the Mellahah. In the darkness
he failed to find the Major, and on the morning of the
23rd not a single soul in the battalion knew anything
about where the Transport had gone, or how it could
be found. They had completely vanished from the ken
of everybody, taking with them our food, forage, cooking
pots, and spare ammunition. The new Transport
Officer, Captain Cunningham, who had been detailed to
take Captain Julian's place, was unable to find any trace
of them when he went to take over charge. They had
mysteriously disappeared from their bivouac and gone
off into the blue.</p>

<p>This was a very disturbing factor in the situation, for
we had orders to start off in pursuit of the enemy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
2 o'clock a.m. next morning. Cunningham, Quartermaster
Smythe, and all available men who could be
pressed into the service, were sent in every direction to
run the Transport to earth.</p>

<p>Eventually Smythe came back to say that he had
been tracking wagon wheels for at least five miles, but
they could not be ours, for the tracks led steadily in a
northerly direction towards the Turkish lines.</p>

<p>After duly strafing Major Ripley for having, this
early in his command, lost his transport, I set off in
quest of the rovers.</p>

<p>Luckily my charger Betty was in splendid condition,
and I certainly put her on her mettle that morning. I
took up the trail that Smythe had abandoned, followed
it for seven or eight miles at a steady canter, and then
lost all trace on hard ground. I had to cast round in a
big circle before I found it once more, then I went on
again for another three or four miles when I met some
Australians. On asking them if they had seen a column
of wagons going northward they said, "No, we have
been along here for a couple of miles, but we have seen
nothing."</p>

<p>This was very disheartening news, and I almost felt
inclined to give up the quest in this direction and turn
back; but having come so far, I made up my mind to go
on, even to the Turkish lines themselves, before I gave
up the hunt.</p>

<p>I was then about eight miles short of the Turkish
position, or what had been the Turkish position at the
foot of the hills towards which the tracks still led.</p>

<p>When I had covered another few miles, to my inexpressible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
relief, I at last caught sight of the Transport,
steadily pursuing its way northward!</p>

<p>I made Betty put on an extra spurt and soon caught
them up. It is lucky that there was no grass about, or
the prairie itself would have caught fire when I at last
overtook the Transport Sergeant. The language
addressed to the jackdaw by the Cardinal Lord Archbishop
of Rheims was angel talk compared to mine.</p>

<p>When I ordered him sharply to get back at once to
where he came from, he was so confused that he
promptly turned his horse round and began to ride off
towards camp&mdash;leaving his baggage wagons still calmly
proceeding in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>I called the dazed sergeant back and told him very
forcibly to halt the column and take the wagons back as
quickly as possible to his original camp. I was never
able to get any satisfactory information from the sergeant
(who by the way was a Welshman and a
Christian) as to what induced him to trek off into the
unknown in such a mad fashion. I can only imagine
that the devil, who lives in the Jordan Valley, had impersonated
Major Ripley and had ordered the sergeant
to push for all he was worth for the Turkish lines, leaving
us without food, water, cooking pots, or ammunition&mdash;in
fact leaving us "beggars by the wayside."</p>

<p>My chase of the transport wasted some precious
hours, but I was back in camp soon after 10 a.m., where
I found the battalion full of bustle and activity, preparing
for concentration on the Auja bridgehead.</p>

<p>On my return to Headquarters I found that Major
Ripley was ill and only fit for hospital. He had had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
most nerve-shattering time while commanding his section;
for his posts were very much exposed and there
was always the dread and anxiety of an attack in overwhelming
numbers. Sleep rarely comes to soothe a
man's nerves in such trying circumstances, especially in
the awful heat we endured in the Mellahah; in fact,
Major Ripley's features had wasted away so much owing
to the worry and anxiety of all he had undergone that he
reminded me of nothing so much as one of the mummified
birds I had once seen in a cave of Upper Egypt. I
never saw Major Ripley again in the battalion, but I am
glad to say he made an excellent recovery, and was
eventually given a good staff job in Alexandria.</p>

<p>I gave the command of the battalion to Major Neill,
and from that moment I had no further anxieties, outside
my own province, with which to contend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">We Go up to Ramoth Gilead.</span></div>


<p>When I took command of the Column I chose
Captain Douglas Leadley as my Staff Officer,
and a better man it would be almost impossible to find.
I never knew Leadley to forget anything, and it was a
great relief to feel that when once I had given him any
instructions, I need have no further anxiety about them,
for he was absolutely reliable and competent in every
way.</p>

<p>When Leadley came to me, Major Neill selected Captain
T. B. Brown to replace him as Adjutant of the 38th
Battalion, and an excellent staff officer he made, as far as
I could judge.</p>

<p>The concentration on the Auja bridgehead proceeded
as rapidly as possible, for the Column had to move soon
after midnight.</p>

<p>I found that the 38th Battalion could not possibly concentrate
in time, for Captain H.H. Harris's Company
was many miles to the north, where it had been sent in
pursuit of the enemy. I therefore ordered Major Neill
to follow me as quickly as possible to Shunat Nimrin, a
position on the Moab foothills, some ten miles to the
eastward of the Auja.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>At 2 a.m. on the 24th, Column Headquarters and the
39th Battalion crossed the Jordan at the Auja bridgehead,
scrambled up the steep Jordan cliffs, and marched
on towards Nimrin.</p>

<p>General Chaytor had meanwhile ordered an advance
upon Es Salt (the ancient Ramoth Gilead) and Amman,
with his whole force, which consisted of the Anzac
Mounted Division (less one squadron), a field battery,
a heavy battery, two mountain batteries, Patterson's
Column, the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, and the 1st
and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment.</p>

<p>The mounted troops pushed forward rapidly, and soon
out-distanced the infantry and guns. The Anzacs were
such gluttons for battle that they broke down every
resistance and completely destroyed and broke
up the enemy before the Infantry could come into
action.</p>

<p>The 20th Indian Infantry and the guns followed the
horsemen, for, from their position on the Jericho-Es
Salt road, they were much better situated to take the lead
than any other dismounted troops.</p>

<p>My Column struck the advancing troops at Nimrin,
where I was just in time to see General Chaytor fly past
in a motor car. The General always believed in being
well to the front when there was a fight on, and has
been known on more than one occasion to be mixed up
in the fray itself.</p>

<p>My orders were to form the rearguard to Chaytor's
Force, and all day long the main Column wound its
way slowly past Nimrin until 3 o'clock in the afternoon
of the 24th. I then gave the order for the 39th to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
advance, and left orders for the 38th, on arrival at
Nimrin, to follow on to Es Salt.</p>

<p>It was interesting to observe the strong positions from
which we had driven the Turks, and to see overturned
cannon, limbers, wagons, ammunition carts strewing the
road; "Jericho Jane," an enormous gun that used to
fire into Jericho, the Divisional Headquarters, and
generally rake us all round, was lying ignominiously on
her back in a ditch; dead bodies of men, horses, and
draught bullocks made the world unpleasant in their
vicinity; Bedouins flocked around like locusts, looting
machine guns, rifles, ammunition and stores of all kinds
which had been abandoned by the Turks in their hasty
flight. The Arabs in these parts had the time of their
lives, for loot is to them as honey to the bee.</p>

<p>General Chaytor had left word at Nimrin that he
wished to see me, so I was anxious to get on to Es Salt
as quickly as possible, where I hoped to find him. I
therefore gave all necessary instructions to Colonel
Margolin, and, leaving Captain Leadley with him in case
anything unforeseen should crop up, and he should
require the assistance of my Staff Officer, I rode
on as fast as possible to Es Salt, taking my groom
with me.</p>

<p>After great difficulty and much squeezing we forced
our way through the miles and miles of wagons, baggage,
guns, etc., which were slowly and painfully crawling up
the steep mountain side towards Es Salt. I arrived
there at about 9 p.m., but failed to find the General,
who had already pushed further ahead. I was hospitably
entertained by the Indian Infantry Brigade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
afterwards turned aside, and, tethering my horse, lay
down a little way off the road, with my saddle for my
pillow, glad to have a blanket to wrap round me on these
heights, which felt decidedly chilly after the suffocating
heat of the Mellahah. I woke up in the middle of the
night just in time to recover Betty, who had broken
loose and was straying off towards a forage cart.
Having tied her up, I settled down again and slept until
dawn. I wondered during the night how it was that my
bed was so warm, and as soon as daylight came I discovered
the reason&mdash;I had been sleeping on a bed of dry
stable litter!</p>

<p>After an early cup of tea with the Indians, I pushed
on through Es Salt to General Chaytor's Headquarters,
which were just beyond. Here I found that the General
had gone on to direct the operations which were then
in progress round Amman. Major Anderson of his Staff
provided me with an excellent breakfast, and soon afterwards
we were joined by my friend, Colonel Bruxner,
who had had a strenuous night marshalling the guns
and transport on their toilsome journey up from the
Valley.</p>

<p>I received telegraphic instruction from General
Chaytor to make Es Salt my Headquarters and put it
into a state of all-round defence.</p>

<p>I put up my "bivvy" a little way out of the town,
under an enormous fig tree then laden with delicious
fruit, close to the Nimrin, which flowed swiftly by,
almost at the edge of our bivouac.</p>

<p>Colonel Margolin and the 39th took over Es Salt and
at once occupied the commanding hills round about,
where he was soon entrenched and ready to give the
enemy a very warm reception in case of attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>The Turks had left a number of sick and wounded
soldiers at this place in a dreadful state. Captain
Redcliffe Salaman took these poor wretches in hand and
soon brought about a wonderful improvement in their
condition. The town itself was in a state of indescribable
filth, and had it not been for the unceasing efforts of
Captain Salaman and the Sanitary Department which
he organised, an outbreak of typhoid or other dreadful
disease must have ensued. No praise is too high for
the work which Salaman did during the period he was
in Medical charge at Es Salt.</p>

<p>Soon after we had established ourselves here I found
that the Bedouins were looting the abandoned Turkish
munitions, stores, etc., right and left; as they were our
allies, I did not want to interfere without orders, so I
reported the matter to General Chaytor.</p>

<p>The General promptly wired me to stop all looting
by these marauders&mdash;a proceeding which annoyed them
intensely. I had to send out strong parties from the
39th Battalion to patrol that part of the country towards
Amman, and the whole of the road from Es Salt back
to Nimrin had, in addition, to be watched and guarded.
The 39th patrolled the country from Es Salt as far as
the El Howeij Bridge, some six miles south of Es Salt,
while the 38th took up guard duty from this point to
Nimrin. This was rather hard luck on the 38th, for
they had almost reached Es Salt when the order to
counter-march came. They had to turn and go back
all that long weary way, practically without rest or food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a march and counter-march that would have
reflected credit on the best marching Regiment in the
British Army, and no better testimonial could be given
than that of Lieut. Cameron, a regular Highlander of
the old school, who freely admitted that this was the very
worst he had ever experienced in all his eighteen years of
soldiering.</p>

<p>Cameron won the Military Cross, and also a bar
thereto, while serving with the 38th Battalion.</p>

<p>Major Neill afterwards told me that he received the
greatest assistance in getting the men along on this trying
march from Captain H.H. Harris, who had the arduous
task of shepherding the weary ones along with the rearguard.</p>

<p>No doubt if was one of these laggards who, some
weeks afterwards, wrote me a letter full of reproaches,
which made me laugh heartily, and helped to brighten
the gloomy days through which I was then passing. I
give an extract from a very lengthy episode:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You kept us in torture for six and a half weeks
at Nablus. Then we left Nablus and thought
after this torture you will send us for a rest, but no,
you make us march to the Jordan in full marching
order. You also gave us a bomb each man to
put in our pocket so as to lighten the burden of the
transport. You had consideration for horses, but
not for humans. We travelled like pedlars to the
Jordan, living on fresh air. When we reached the
Jordan, it was a grand place, was it not? It surprises
me you could not pick out a worse place to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>send us. Is there any worse place than the
Mellalah in this God-forsaken country? (Evidently
a non-Zionist, this fellow!) You kept us in this
hot hole for another six-and-a-half weeks, no other
troops ever being known to stay there for more than
two or three weeks&mdash;but of course anywhere was
good enough for the Jews."</p></blockquote>

<p>From the above it will be seen that at least some of the
men were of the opinion that I was responsible for their
troubles, while all the time I was getting into the bad
books of authority in my endeavours to get them better
treatment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crown of Victory.</span></div>


<p>The moment things were satisfactorily settled in the
neighbourhood of Es Salt I hurried on to
Amman. Jumping into a passing motor, I discovered
that the name of the officer in the car was Lowe, and on
asking him whether he was, by chance, any relation of
a man I knew named Harry Lowe, he replied, "I am
his brother."</p>

<p>On our arrival at Amman I found that General
Chaytor's camp was some distance beyond the town and
close to the Hedjaz Railway Station. Seeing the divisional
flag flying over his tent, I made for it, and was
delighted at last to run him to earth.</p>

<p>I heartily congratulated him on the great victory he
had won in such record time. In four days his troops
had covered over 60 miles; he had forced his way
through the hills and mountains of Moab, a most difficult
country, in the face of a superior force; he had captured
the two ancient cities of Es Salt and Amman, got
astride of the Hedjaz Railway, and had completely routed
the 4th Turkish Army. He had captured altogether
some 11,000 prisoners, some 60 guns, about 150
machine-guns, hundreds of tons of ammunition of all
kinds, millions of rounds of small arms ammunition, large
quantities of railway rolling-stock, and all kinds of other
material, foodstuffs, horses, mules, transport wagons,
motor lorries, etc.&mdash;altogether as brilliant a piece of work
as was done in this or any other theatre of the Great
War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>I would have those who pin their faith to the sword
make a special note of the fact that not a single sabre or
lance was carried by the mounted men. The hefty
Anzac was able to do all that was wanted by the combination
of man, horse, and rifle.</p>

<p>Of course Chaytor's Force lacked one great weapon,
and that was a war correspondent to write up its deeds!</p>

<p>While I was in General Chaytor's camp a sad accident
happened. A Signalling Sergeant quite close to us
was examining a "dud" aerial bomb when it exploded
in his hands, killing him and wounding several others.</p>

<p>I found Amman (the Philadelphia of the Romans) rich
in old Græco-Roman architectural remains. A mighty
amphitheatre, still in a fairly good state of preservation,
stands out boldly amidst the ruins. Judging by the
number of shattered columns and broken arches strewn
about over a wide area, it must have been a very important
city in the days when Rome was mistress of the
world. Little or nothing of the old Rabbah Ammon is
left. The walls of a very ancient citadel still crown a
hill-top close by the Roman city, but whether it is the
citadel which so long resisted Joab, or a later structure,
I cannot say.</p>

<p>I remained at Amman all night, in the shadow of the
great ruined amphitheatre. Once it must have rocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to the roar of the multitude encircling its spacious arena.
Now all was silent. Only bats and owls circled through
its broken arches or flew from its tilted columns,
alarmed perchance by the curse of an Australian trooper
sleeping uneasily amidst its ruins. While the bivouac
fires yet flickered on this hoary pile I sought the shelter
of a motor lorry, in which, rolled in a blanket, I lay snug
and warm throughout the night.</p>

<p>From my own observation I can testify that the words
of the Prophet Ezekiel were literally fulfilled when he
wrote: "And I will make Rabbah (Ammon) a stable
for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for
flocks."&mdash;(Ezekiel, Chap. XXV. verse 5.)</p>

<p>It must have been a very pleasant city in the old days,
and I see no reason why its glories should not be revived
under a stable form of Government. The country all
round is fruitful and its waters sweet and abundant.</p>

<p>In the present straggling town there is a large colony
of Circassians, and in the two previous raids made by
the British on this place these people had in each case
made a treacherous attack on our rearguard. The New
Zealand Mounted Rifles suffered somewhat severely in
the raid made on March 30th, 1918.</p>

<p>I left the ancient capital of the Ammonites soon after
daybreak and, as I journeyed towards Es Salt, I had a
magnificent view of the snow-capped Lebanons away in
the far distance, while Gilead and Bashan lay spread
out before me to the foot of Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>Es Salt and the hills surrounding it form the gateway
to a vast rich hinterland. I have never seen grapes as
large as those that grow in Gilead, or tasted any to
compare with them in flavour. Figs, too, were delicious
and abundant in and about Es Salt.</p>

<p>Rumours now began to get about that the Turkish
force, still on the Hedjaz Railway to the south of
Amman, would attempt to break through and try to
escape northwards to Damascus by way of Nimrin.</p>

<p>General Chaytor ordered me to take steps to meet such
an emergency, so I wired to Major Neill to put the place
in a state of defence, and on September 28th I proceeded
there myself and resumed command of the
battalion.</p>

<p>While Chaytor's Force was holding the enemy on the
Jordan and, later, chasing him through the Moab hills,
the C.-in-C. was using the bulk of his forces in destroying
the enemy holding the country to the West of the Jordan,
and a very brief account of the operations may prove
interesting to the reader.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Jaffa a Franco-British force
was assembled consisting of five Divisions of Infantry,
a French detachment about 4,000 strong, the 5th
Australian Light Horse Brigade, two brigades of mountain
artillery, and eighteen batteries of heavy and siege
artillery.</p>

<p>Carefully concealed in the orange and olive groves
round about Jaffa and Ludd lay the 4th and 5th Cavalry
Divisions, the Australian Mounted Division (less one
Brigade), and four squadrons of French Colonial Cavalry
(Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique).</p>

<p>All these were ready to dash north the moment the
infantry and artillery had broken a gap in the enemy's
line to the North of Jaffa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>With this highly mobile force a brilliant victory was
achieved, but of course the historian will not give to the
E.E.F. campaign the extravagant praise which has been
lavished upon it by an ill-informed public, ignorant as
yet of the fact that in the field of operations the strength
of the British to that of the Turk was as that of a tiger
to a tom-cat.</p>

<p>The bulk of the Turkish forces were on or south of a
line drawn from Jisr ed Damie, on the Jordan, through
Nablus and Tul Keram to the Mediterranean. His
fighting strength on this front was, roughly, 17,000
Infantry, 1,000 Cavalry, and 266 guns. His line of
communication was long and bad. He was about 1,200
miles from his base at Constantinople, and, owing to incomplete
tunnels at Amanus and Taurus and a change
of gauge at Ryak, there were no less than three bad
breaks in the single line of railway which had to carry
his reinforcements, munitions, equipment, and food both
to the Palestinian and Mesopotamian fronts.</p>

<p>His troops were badly fed and badly led; medical
arrangements were very poor; there was considerable
friction between the Turks and Germans, and the
Turkish Army was composed of a mixture of races, many
of them hating their masters with a fierce hatred.</p>

<p>Here were all the elements of a <i>débâcle</i> on a grand
scale.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 19th one of the most
triumphant cavalry marches ever recorded in the world's
history began at Jaffa, and before the troops engaged in
it drew rein in far-off Aleppo, five weeks later, they had
covered some 500 miles through an enemy's country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
captured or destroyed over 50,000 Turks, seized
Damascus, Beyrout, and Aleppo, and brought to an
inglorious end the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>This was no mean record for a mere handful of
mounted men to accomplish. We must not forget, however,
that without the lavish help of the other arms&mdash;infantry,
artillery, and especially the Air Force, victory
on such a colossal scale could not have been achieved.</p>

<p>It almost seems as if this crowning victory had been
pre-ordained to take place in the year 1918. Everybody
knows that the Jewish era differs from the Christian
era, but perhaps not so many are aware that the Jewish
year 5679 corresponds to the year 1918 of our era. A
peculiarity of the Hebrew language is that every numeral
has a special meaning other than that connected with time
or figures. In the dim and distant past, when seers,
sages, and scribes were devoutly engaged in evolving
such things, was it even then pre-ordained that this
crowning victory&mdash;this victory which will surely hasten
the restoration of Israel&mdash;should take place in the year
5679? However that may be, it is certainly extraordinary
that the figures 5, 6, 7, 9, being interpreted,
should mean Ha-atereth&mdash;"Crown of Victory."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Strategical Value of Palestine.</span></div>


<p>When Turkey, unfortunately for herself, ranged
her forces on the side of our enemies in the
Great War she severed a friendship which had lasted
for the greater part of a century. Our policy had for
many years been to uphold the integrity of the Ottoman
Empire because, with that Power holding Palestine, our
Egyptian interests were quite safe. Now that the
Turkish Empire has practically ceased to exist, Palestine
becomes of cardinal importance to our Eastern interests.</p>

<p>Situated as it is at the Gate of the three Continents of
Europe, Asia, and Africa, its strategical, political, and
economic importance is beyond computation and out of
all proportion to the size of this diminutive country.</p>

<p>Students of strategy and military history will agree
that Palestine, although some distance from the Suez
Canal region, dominates that main artery of our trade
and commerce.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary of Egypt, running from Rafa
on the Mediterranean to Akaba on the Gulf of that name
in the Red Sea, is, from a military point of view, worthless.
History tells us that all down the ages armies have
crossed the Sinai Desert and worked their will on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
dwellers by the Nile. Early in the War we ourselves
were unable to hold this Egyptian Frontier and were
forced to retire to the line of the Suez Canal. It is true
we defeated the Turks there and drove them out of
Egypt, but the risk to our communications was very
grave. It is a risk that should never again be taken,
and for the future the Suez Canal must be defended, at
all events on the Eastern side, from its strategical
frontier&mdash;Palestine. With a friendly people established
in the Judæan strongholds, and with sea power in our
hands, the invasion of Egypt from the East or North
would be a well-nigh impossible enterprise. It was
always a cause of surprise to me that we did not very
early in the War seize and fortify the harbours of Haifa
and Jaffa. This might easily have been done, as they
were practically undefended, and the people were in
their hearts pro-British. Even Gaza could have been
occupied and fortified in the early days. With these
three towns in our hands no Turkish force could have
been organised in Palestine or used against Egypt. No
army could possibly march down the maritime plain with
these occupied towns menacing their flank, while the
other route to Egypt by the eastward of the Jordan
Valley is almost impossible for a large army.</p>

<p>Some eighty years ago Ibrahim Pasha was forced to
retire to Egypt from Damascus by this eastern route
because we held the coast ports. He left the ancient
capital of Syria with some eighty thousand men, and,
although he fought no battle on the way, his losses from
sickness, hunger, thirst, and fatigue amounted to over
sixty-five thousand men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>This gives one some little idea of the chance we missed
in not making adequate use of our sea power by seizing
the coast towns in the Levant during the Great War.</p>

<p>The physical conformation of Palestine adds enormously
to its strategical strength.</p>

<p>The country is divided into four longitudinal belts running
practically throughout the length of the country
from North to South. Along the sea coast run the
narrow maritime plains of Philistia, Sharon, and Acre.
These narrow plains stretch from the borders of Egypt
to the mountains of Lebanon.</p>

<p>The next belt of country consists of the continuation of
the Lebanon range, which runs down practically unbroken
through central Palestine, losing itself in the
Southern Desert.</p>

<p>This hilly range constitutes the heart of the Holy
Land and comprises the provinces of Galilee, Samaria,
and Judæa. The only complete break in this range
occurs between Galilee and Samaria, where the Plain of
Esdraelon and the Valley of Jezreel cut right across and
leave an open doorway from East to West. Through
this gap from time immemorial armies have marched and
counter-marched to and from Egypt.</p>

<p>The next belt of country is the great depression of
the Jordan Valley, the deepest known in the world. It
runs from "the waters of Merom," near the foothills of
Hermon, where it is on a level with the Mediterranean,
to the Dead Sea, where it is nearly 1,300 ft. below sea-level.</p>

<p>To the eastward of the Jordan Valley runs the table-land
of the Hauran, Gilead, and Moab. This rich belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of territory is from twenty to sixty miles wide and ranges
from 2,000 ft. to 4,000 ft. above sea-level. It loses
itself to the South and East in the Arabian and Syrian
Deserts.</p>

<p>The natural frontiers of Palestine are the Mediterranean
on the West, the Syrian Desert to the East, the
Arabian and Sinai Deserts to the South, and the difficult
mountain passes of the Lebanon to the North. Next to
the sea no better frontiers can be found than mountain
passes and deserts.</p>

<p>It will therefore be seen that if Palestine is given
anything like her Biblical frontiers, troops could readily
be placed on any threatened point and practically make
the invasion of the country an impossibility.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a small national army in Palestine
would make that country almost as impregnable as are
the Cantons of Switzerland.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance to British interests to
further the creation of a friendly State in Palestine which
would act as a buffer between herself and any aggressive
neighbour to the North or East.</p>

<p>The greatest soldiers and statesmen of the past
realised that in order to obtain dominion over the East
it was first of all necessary to secure the friendly co-operation
of the people of Palestine.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great knew what a help to his Greek
Empire of the East the Jews would be. He therefore
showed them the greatest friendship, and allowed them
every possible civil and religious liberty.</p>

<p>Later on, when Palestine came under the dominion of
Rome, Julius Cæsar, the first and greatest of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Emperors, realized so fully that without a friendly
Palestine he could not hope to overthrow the Parthians
and Persians to the eastward that in order to obtain the
friendship of the Jews he freed Palestine from tribute,
withdrew his legions from the country, exempted Jews
from serving in the army, and allowed them full liberty
of conscience, not only in Palestine but throughout the
entire Empire.</p>

<p>Coming down to more modern times, we find
Napoleon following as far as possible the policy of his
two great predecessors. At one time, early in his
career, he made an effort to restore the Jews to Palestine,
and he would probably have been successful in his
scheme, and made himself ruler of a French Empire in
the East, only, unfortunately for him, Nelson, at the
battle of the Nile, deprived him of the command of the
sea. Nothing daunted by this, however, he marched
his soldiers through the Sinai Desert and subdued practically
all Palestine, but, owing to British sea-power, we
were able to throw troops into Acre, and by his defeat
at the famous siege of that place, Napoleon's eastern
ambitions came to an end.</p>

<p>Great as was the importance of a friendly Palestine to
the Greek and Roman Empires, a friendly Palestine
to-day is of immensely more importance to the peace and
prosperity of the British Empire. Our statesmen were,
therefore, but following in the footsteps of the greatest
men of the past when they issued the world-famous
Balfour Declaration pledging England to use her best
endeavours to establish a National Home in Palestine
for the Jewish people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>It is useless to deny the fact that England is not nearly
so popular in the Near East as she was thirty or forty
years ago. The Egyptians have shown us pretty
clearly that they have no love for us, while it is very
evident that the Arab kingdoms have ambitions of their
own in those regions, which might prove a very grave
menace to our eastern communications. Naturally,
Turkey&mdash;or what is left of that once great Empire&mdash;realises
that it is to England that she owes her downfall,
while the policy of Greece, at the moment at all events,
also runs counter to our own.</p>

<p>It is very necessary, therefore, that Palestine should
be colonised by a people whose interests will go hand in
hand with those of England and who will readily grasp
at union with the British Empire.</p>

<p>The Jews are the only people who fulfil these conditions.
They have ever looked upon Palestine as their
natural heritage, and although they were ruthlessly torn
from it some two thousand years ago, yet through all the
terrible years of their exile they have never lost the
imperishable hope of a return to the Land of Promise.
They have always had a friendly feeling for this country,
and if England now deals justly with Israel, this friendly
feeling will be increased tenfold. They would be quite
unable to stand alone in Palestine for some time, and
therefore their one aim and object would be to co-operate
wholeheartedly with the Power that had not only reinstated
them in their own land, but whose strong arm
was adequate to protect them from the encroachments
and aggressions of neighbouring states.</p>

<p>It will undoubtedly be their policy to walk hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hand with England. British and Jewish interests are so
similar and so interwoven that they fit into each other as
the hand does the glove.</p>

<p>In short, when the long-expected Restoration of the
Jewish people to the Promised Land becomes an accomplished
fact, then the vital interests of the British
Empire in those regions will be unassailable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Hospital Scandal at Jerusalem.</span></div>


<p>It will be remembered that I had been ordered to
proceed to Nimrin to intercept any Turks who
might attempt to break through from the South. When
I reached my camp I found about 1,500 Turkish
prisoners already concentrated there; hundreds of them
were too feeble and ill to be marched further, but about
1,000 were considered fit enough to go on, and these
were escorted by Captain Harris and a small detachment
of the 38th to Jericho, and, after a short rest there,
on to the prisoners' cage at Ludd.</p>

<p>On October 1st Battalion Headquarters moved to
Jerusalem, and on the way thither it was pitiful to see
these unfortunate Turkish prisoners, starving and sick,
crawling at a snail's pace up the steep ascent from the
Jordan Valley through the Judæan Wilderness; many
fell by the way and died from sheer exhaustion. The
medical arrangements were quite inadequate to cope
even with our own sick, who now began to feel the effect
of the poisonous Mellahah, and went down daily by
scores.</p>

<p>Our new camp was situated about a mile outside the
walls of Jerusalem to the southward, on the Hebron road,
and by the time we reached it hundreds of the men,
exhausted and worn out from the effects of their terrible
experiences in the Jordan Valley, were ill with malaria;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
practically every officer also was struck down with the
same fell disease. I myself had been far from well
throughout the recent operations, but I managed, with
the skilful aid of our Medical Officer, Captain Haldin
Davis, to keep going.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just before we arrived in Camp, there
had been a terrific downpour of rain, which had
thoroughly soaked the ground, and as there was no
hospital accommodation available, the unfortunate
patients had to lie on the wet earth, with only one
blanket, and no medical comforts or treatment. There
were no nurses or orderlies, and the men received no
attention of any kind, except such as could be given by
those of their comrades who were still able to move
about. As a result of this lamentable state of affairs,
which could easily have been prevented by a little forethought
on the part of the Staff, many died of malaria
and pneumonia, and one poor fellow killed himself by
cutting his throat in his delirium.</p>

<p>Captain Davis had been taken ill at Nimrin, and removed
in an ambulance to hospital. I made urgent
appeals for another doctor, but without avail, and it was
nearly a whole year before the authorities thought it
worth while to provide a medical officer for this Jewish
Battalion, which at one time was almost 2,000 strong.
Not only were the Jewish troops unable to find hospital
accommodation, but hundreds of others also&mdash;British,
Australian, New Zealand, and Indian.</p>

<p>The whole thing was a grave scandal, which must be
laid at the door of the responsible muddlers.</p>

<p>It was distressing to see the German Hospice on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Mount of Olives, a building which was absolutely ideal
for a Hospital, used for Staff purposes, while the sick
and wounded men, who had suffered all the hardships
and done all the fighting, were allowed to lie about on
the wet ground in and around Jerusalem. The muddle
was not the fault of the few medical men on the spot, for
they worked like slaves. The whole of the blame for
this wanton lack of organisation rests with G.H.Q. I
had written in the previous July recommending that
hospital accommodation should be provided at Jerusalem
for Jewish troops, but no notice was taken of my recommendation.
If this had been acted upon many deaths
and much unnecessary suffering would have been
avoided.</p>

<p>In my own battalion we lost over a score of men in
this way, who, I am convinced, would not have died if
proper hospital arrangements had been available, and
had it not been for the timely arrival of Captain Salaman,
R.A.M.C., with the 39th Battalion, to whom I turned
over all my sick, the death-roll would in all probability
have been much greater.</p>

<p>The battalion numbers, owing to the hardships we
had undergone, were reduced from a strength of nearly
1,000 to about six officers and less than 150 men.</p>

<p>I can illustrate the pettiness of at least some of the
G.H.Q. Staff no better than by giving the following
correspondence.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that I had reported to General
Allenby in the Jordan Valley that the medical arrangements
were not good. This apparently displeased some
of the Staff, for they hunted up a private telegram which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
I had sent some months previously (on July 18th),
addressed to the Secretary, Medical Committee, Jewish
Regiment, London, in which I had said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You should see Sir Nevil Macready. Am
strongly advising base to be at Jerusalem."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On discovering this mare's nest the D.A.G. sent the
following memo. to General Chaytor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A. 13780.<br />
Subject: Medical<br />
Arrangements for<br />
Jewish Battalions.<br />
</p>

<div class="right">

Chaytor's Force.<br />
</div>

<p>Please find attached herewith a copy of a telegram
purporting to have been sent by the Officer Commanding
38th Royal Fusiliers.</p>

<p>Please call upon this officer to furnish his reasons
and such explanation as he may have to offer for
advising a course of action which concerns the
C.-in-C. under whom he is serving, without
reference to or obtaining permission from the
C.-in-C.</p>

<div class="right">

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this ado because I had simply sent a private telegram
to the Jewish Hospital Committee months before
to say I was advising a Hospital base to be set up at
Jerusalem. This telegram was in reply to a cable from
the Committee in London asking if special hospital
accommodation could be provided for Jewish soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>From the date on this memorandum it will be seen
that G.H.Q. thought fit to send out such a communication
on the very eve of the great advance. It would
have been much more useful if the Deputy Adjutant
General had devoted his attention to providing Hospital
accommodation for the unfortunate sick and wounded,
instead of choosing such a moment to harry troops in
the field engaged in a great offensive, the success of
which meant everything to England.</p>

<p>There was no excuse whatever for this memo.,
because on the 26th June, 1918, immediately on receipt
of the cable from the Hospital Committee, I had sent
the following to G.H.Q.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
38th Battn. R.F.<br />
No. A/412/1/3.<br />
31st Inf. Brg. No. 57d.<br />
10th Divn. No. 1324A.<br />

G.H.Q. 1st Echelon No. a/13780.<br />
<span class="smcap">Head</span> Q. 31st. Inf. Brg.<br />
</p>

<p>I have received the following cable from the Hon.
Sec. Medical Committee for Jewish Units:</p>

<p>"The Matron-in-Chief Q.A.I.M.N.S.
sanctions Jewish Nursing Staff for Service in
Palestine. Can you arrange Jewish wards in
existing military Hospitals or other special
provision?</p>

<p>
"Committee awaits reply."<br />
</p>

<p>With reference to the above cable I have to
state that when I was organising the Jewish Units
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>in England, I had recommended a Jewish Base
Hospital, and the A.G., Sir N. Macready, had
sanctioned this, and given instructions, after I left
England for Egypt, that it was to be based at
Plymouth.</p>

<p>The A.G. probably misunderstood my intention
when he based it at Plymouth, as I had intended
that the Hospital should be based in Egypt or
Palestine. I therefore wrote home and suggested
that there was no need for a special Jewish Hospital
in England.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the above cable is the
result of some negotiation with the A.G., and I
would suggest that this matter be referred to
G.H.Q., 1st Echelon, so that they may get into
touch with the W.O., and find out what has been
decided upon in this question. <i>Personally I would
recommend that the Hospital should be at Jerusalem</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To the above I received the following reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

</p>


<p>With reference to your memo. No. P.C.A. 565,

the question of Jewish wards in Military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>

being followed.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will be seen therefore that if the D.A.G. had only
known what was going on in his own office there would
have been no need for him to trump up this petty inquisition,
or trouble anybody for an explanation about a
private telegram which had been sent to London a
couple of months previously. General Chaytor had the
good sense to retain the D.A.G.'s memo, until active
operations were over, upon which he sent it on to me.
As an explanation had to be given, the following is a
copy of my reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Headquarters,<br />
Chaytor's Force</span>.
</p>
<div class="right">A/412/1/3.<br /></div>

<p>With reference to your M.C.412 dated 13/10/18
re medical arrangements for Jewish Battalions, I
think that perhaps it will explain the situation if I
point out that I was in direct touch with the War
Office on all questions affecting the Jewish Battalions,
and I had several interviews with Sir Nevil
Macready on matters relating to this Jewish movement;
in fact, I was looked upon in England as the
responsible leader, and I had every conceivable
kind of case to investigate and decide. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
already told Sir Nevil Macready my views while
in England re Hospital for Jewish soldiers, and
when I got a cable from this unofficial medical
committee I replied in a private cable recommending
them to consult him, and stating my own private
views on the question.</p>

<p>I certainly do not consider this private expression
of opinion as "advising a course of action," and
when I sent the cable nothing was further from my
mind. I simply referred the Committee to Sir
Nevil Macready, with whom I had already discussed
the matter, and said what I personally
thought the best place for a base.</p>

<p>Naturally no action could be taken without consulting
the C.-in-C., E.E.F.; as a matter of fact
I did forward a copy of this telegram to G.H.Q.,
and also a letter in which I recommended Jerusalem
as a base.</p>

<p>I attach copy of my letter and, at the same time,
I regret that my advice re Hospital at Jerusalem
was not taken. If a Jewish Hospital had been
established there, before the recent operations took
place, much unnecessary suffering and many deaths
would have been avoided. Men of the Jewish
Battalions, who were very ill indeed, were lying
about in hundreds on wet ground in Jerusalem,
because there was no room for them in the overcrowded
hospitals, and it was quite impossible to
get our sick evacuated for days after they had really
become cot cases.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no fault of the Medical Officers on the
spot; it was simply impossible to cope with the
sick for want of Medical Officers and hospital
accommodation. I may mention that of the Battalion
under my command alone there are 27
Officers and 824 other ranks in hospital, as a result
of the Jordan Valley and subsequent operations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I must say I am somewhat surprised
that a private communication which I sent to a
private individual in July last should be produced
at this stage.</p>

<p>I again and most emphatically state that I advised
no course of action, merely gave my private opinion,
and had no idea of any such action when I sent the
cable.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of the representations made by the Medical
Committee in England on behalf of the Jewish Battalions,
a Staff of Jewish Nurses, in charge of Sister
Oppenheimer, were sent out to the 27th General Hospital
at Abbasieh, near Cairo, and I have on many
occasions heard expressions of gratitude showered on
these nurses by men who had been under their care.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a number of Palestinian
Jewish ladies volunteered for Nursing Service as soon
as the British occupied Jaffa and Jerusalem. I had
strongly urged that their offer of service should be
accepted and that they should be taken on and trained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for I foresaw that they would be required as soon as a
determined effort to oust the Turk from Palestine was
made.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my advice was not taken, for, as I have
already shown, they were sadly needed in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Later on about half-a-dozen Jewish ladies, including
the Misses Berline, who were well known in Jaffa and
Jerusalem, were enrolled and attached to the General
Hospital at Belah. I went there on more than one
occasion to see my men, and on enquiring from the
Matron-in-Charge how the Jewish nurses were getting
on she told me that she had never had better or more
conscientious workers under her in all her experience.</p>

<p>It was deplorable that the Staff had ignored the voluntary
offer of the Jewish ladies until it was almost too late
to make use of their services.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Life at Ludd.</span></div>


<p>On the 9th October the battered remnant of the
battalion moved from Jerusalem to Ludd by rail,
where it was taken on the strength of Lines of Communication
troops for garrison duties.</p>

<p>When we heard that we were to be severed from the
Anzacs our feeling was one of regret, for every individual
in the battalion had the greatest admiration, respect, and
affection for General Chaytor and his Staff, and, in fact,
a feeling of real comradeship for every officer and man
in the Anzac Mounted Division.</p>

<p>My sick and ailing could not even yet be taken into
Hospital owing to lack of accommodation, so I left them
attached to the 39th Battalion, under the care of Captain
Salaman, R.A.M.C.</p>

<p>Our transport had been ordered to proceed from
Jerusalem to Ludd by road on the 5th October, but as the
animals were worn to mere skin and bone by hard work,
and nearly all the drivers were down with malaria, I
represented to the authorities that it would be impossible
for them to move for at least a week, so they remained
in Jerusalem for some days after Battalion Headquarters
had left the City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>When eventually the transport marched in to Ludd I
found both animals and men in a most pitiable condition.
One of my best N.C.O.s, Corporal Lloyd, was delirious
with fever, and several other men who should have gone
into Hospital at Jerusalem but were unable to gain admission
were brought down on the wagons. All these I sent
into the local Hospital; Corporal Lloyd unfortunately did
not recover, and died soon after he was admitted. Of
the half-dozen officers who had so far escaped the
malaria, one after another went down and were carried
off to Hospital, until, out of the whole battalion, only
Captain Leadley, Lieutenant Bullock, and myself were
left in Camp!</p>

<p>Major Neill was one of the last to succumb, and his
attack was so severe that his life was despaired of. He
was on the "dangerously ill" list for some time, but
fortunately recovered.</p>

<p>Day after day the few remaining men we had left went
to hospital until, in the end, I was put to such straits that
I had to appeal once more to the Australians, who had
a reinforcement camp near us under the command of
Major Ferguson. I rode over and told him the difficulty
I had in finding men even to feed my animals, and asked
him to spare me a score of troopers to help with the
exercising, watering, and grooming, etc., of the transport
animals.</p>

<p>As usual, the Australians were all out to help, and
readily gave me all the assistance I asked for.</p>

<p>Soon after the 38th Battalion left Jerusalem, Colonel
Margolin also received orders to proceed to Ludd,
although it was well known that hundreds of sick were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in the camp. What would have happened to these unfortunate
sufferers if he had obeyed orders and marched
away leaving them to their fate, sick and helpless as
they were, I shall leave the reader to imagine. Luckily
for these poor fellows Colonel Margolin refused to leave
until such time as they could be accommodated in
Hospital.</p>

<p>Eventually he succeeded in getting his men into
medical wards, and then he and what was left of his
battalion came and camped within a mile of us at Surafend,
a village between Ludd and Jaffa.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd October Colonel Margolin
and Captain Salaman rode into my camp and complained
to me of the discrimination and unfair treatment
to which the Jewish soldiers were being subjected in the
Hospitals&mdash;giving me various instances to illustrate
certain of their statements.</p>

<p>As the Senior Officer of the Jewish Battalions, not
being myself a Jew, I was deeply hurt at the un-English
methods adopted towards men who had done so well in
the field in England's cause, and felt that I would not be
doing my duty to those under my command, and to
Jewry generally, unless I protested against this unfair
discrimination.</p>

<p>I considered that the best way of bringing matters to
a head was by requesting to be relieved of my command
as a protest against the anti-Jewish policy which prevailed.
I accordingly sent forward my resignation. This
found its way to G.H.Q., but as certain individuals there
had no desire to see me land unmuzzled in England, my
resignation was not accepted. Some of the Staff knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
only too well that if I were free to return to England I
would at once let the authorities there know that their
representatives in Palestine were not carrying out the
declared policy of the Imperial Government, but, on the
contrary, were doing their best to make of the Balfour
Declaration a mere "scrap of paper."</p>

<p>As G.H.Q. was then only some two miles from my
Camp I thought it might help matters if I could see
Major-General Louis Jean Bols, the Chief-of-Staff, and
get him to put a stop to the persecution that was going
on, and see that his underlings "played the game." I
therefore called on this gentleman, but he, for reasons
best known to himself, refused to see me.</p>

<p>I told his A.D.C. that I was camped close by and
would be glad to see the General any time that was
convenient to him, but I left his office feeling there never
would be a convenient time, and so, in fact, it turned
out.</p>

<p>When my resignation was refused and my request for
an interview treated in the same manner, I made a
vigorous protest against the anti-Jewish policy which
prevailed, and stated that if it was not altered I would
have the matter placed before the Secretary of State for
War in Parliament.</p>

<p>As a result of this I got a letter from G.H.Q. requesting
me to furnish a list of the complaints I wished
to make, and also asking me to forward recommendations
for the improvement and comfort of the Jewish
Battalion.</p>

<p>In my reply I pointed out how the battalion had suffered
owing to the discrimination to which it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
subjected, and gave specific instances of unfair and unjust
treatment during our service with the E.E.F.</p>

<p>I also forwarded a separate memorandum recommending
various changes for the improvement and comfort of
the men. I made five specific suggestions; not a single
one of these was carried out.</p>

<p>One of my suggestions was that a special Jewish
name and badge should be given to the battalion. This
had been promised by the War Office, but the fact that
it was granted was <i>purposely withheld from our knowledge</i>
by the Staff, and it was only by accident, a whole
year later, that I discovered this deliberate shelving of
Army Council Orders by G.H.Q. in Egypt.</p>

<p>This could not have been an oversight because I had
written more than once to enquire whether this distinction
had yet been conferred on the battalion.</p>

<p>Having seen the majority of my officers and men all
carried off to Hospital, and feeling ill and depressed in
my lonely camp, I sat down late one night and wrote a
letter of condolence to Mrs. Cross. I told her that
although we had wired to every Turkish Hospital, from
Es Salt to Damascus, we could obtain no information
about her husband; I wound up my letter by stating that
although there might still be some very faint hope, she
must steel herself to face the facts, for I feared she would
never see her husband again.</p>

<p>It must have been close on midnight when I lay down,
and, as I was unable to sleep, I was reading by the dim
light of a candle when suddenly I saw a white ghostly
face appear in the tent door, and only that I knew Cross
was dead I would have thought it was the face of Cross.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Then a sepulchral voice said, "Are you awake, Sir?"
and I began to wonder if it were all a dream. When the
figure approached the light, I saw that it really <i>was</i>
Cross, so I bounded up to give him a welcome&mdash;such a
welcome as one would give to a friend who had risen from
the dead.</p>

<p>It appeared that when the patrol had been ambushed,
Cross got wounded and lay under a sandbank where he
was discovered by the Turks; they carried him off, and,
as they were then retiring as fast as they could, took
him with them, pushed him on to Amman, and from
there by rail to Damascus. He was about to be sent
further north when the British entered the city. In the
confusion Cross made good his escape and eventually
worked his way back to me. Thus it was that nobody
knew anything of his whereabouts, for he had never
reported to any of the Hospitals en route.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cross had already been informed by the War
Office that he was missing and reported killed. I told
Cross that I had just posted a letter to his wife to say
that I feared that he must have been killed: he, of course,
at once sent a private cable to tell her that he was alive
and well, while I sent an official one to the War Office
giving the same account. At all events, my letter of
condolence to Mrs. Cross will always be a good souvenir
of the part her husband took in the Great War.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">At Rafa.</span></div>


<p>The Armistice with Turkey was announced on the
31st October, 1918, amid the firing of guns and
rockets and joy stunts by the Air Force above our camp
at Ludd.</p>

<p>On the 6th November the battalion was ordered to
proceed to Rafa to recuperate, refit and reorganise, and
on the 7th, in the early morning, we arrived at this
frontier station bordering on "the desert and the town."</p>

<p>Rafa is actually in Egypt, just over the borders of
Palestine, on the Palestine-Egyptian Railway line some
five miles from the Mediterranean, and here the tents
of Israel were pitched.</p>

<p>Along the whole coast in this neighbourhood there
runs a belt, about four miles deep, of sand dunes and
sand hills. These are very irregular in outline, running
in some places to peaks nearly 100 feet in height, and in
others forming miniature precipices, valleys and gullies.
It is, in fact, a mountainous country on a lilliputian scale.</p>

<p>The sand is so firm that a horse can be ridden all over
it, thereby giving great joy to the hunters of the jackals
and hyenas which roam on its barren surface. The air
on this stretch of sandy dunes is wonderfully fresh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
exhilarating, and we drank it in with delight after our
trying experience in the Jordan Valley. The seashore
itself abounds with millions of curious shells.</p>

<p>The sand belt ends abruptly landwards and, at the
very edge of it, the Bedouin scratches up the soil with
an antiquated plough which dates from the time of
Abraham. Green waving crops, pleasant to the eye,
may be seen almost under the shadow of a sand cliff.
The country inland consists of a somewhat sandy soil
and gently undulating plains which are, for the greater
part, cultivated by Arabs who live in scattered villages,
and by Bedouins who come and go as the spirit moves
them. The whole place is honeycombed with holes
burrowed by the little conies, which makes riding at a
fast pace somewhat hazardous.</p>

<p>Such was the quiet little spot in which we found ourselves
after our strenuous and exciting days in the Jordan
Valley and the Land of Gilead. Day by day our men
gradually came back from Hospital and, owing to drafts
from the 40th Battalion, our strength was soon over 30
officers and 1,500 other ranks.</p>

<p>After a brief time for rest, we took over "Line of
Communication" duties, and found ourselves with many
miles of railway and country to safeguard. Our life
now became one constant round of guards, escorts,
fatigues, and drills whenever a few men could be spared
from other duties for the latter purpose. There were
thousands of prisoners of war in our custody, as well
as a huge captured Turkish ammunition depot, supply
stores, engineer park, and all kinds of workshops, etc.,
etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

(<i>See page <a href="#Page_173">173</a></i>)</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon after we got to Rafa I lost the services of
Captain Leadley, M.C., who was demobilized at his own
request and returned to England. I selected to succeed
him Captain Duncan Sandison&mdash;as stubborn a Scot as
ever wore a kilt, a first-rate officer, loyal to the core,
and a great favourite with everybody except the evil-doers.</p>

<p>Early in December I received another large draft of
raw Jewish recruits from the 40th Battalion Royal
Fusiliers&mdash;all American citizens.</p>

<p>I strongly objected to these untrained men being sent
to me under the circumstances in which I was placed, for
it was impossible to give them any training owing to
the excessive duties we were called upon to perform
day and night. I knew that the result of putting raw
recruits to fulfil duties which should have been carried
out only by seasoned soldiers, must, before very long,
end in disaster. I foresaw endless breaches of discipline,
not because the men were evilly disposed, but because
they were untrained and knew nothing of military
discipline.</p>

<p>I accordingly urged the Staff to remove all these
recruits, of whom I had about 800, to a training centre,
and repeatedly warned the authorities of what the result
must be if this were not done, but not the slightest notice
was taken of my appeal.</p>

<p>It was a thousand pities that these enthusiastic
American volunteers did not get a fair chance to
show their mettle. I well remember how favourably
I was impressed with their physique and
general appearance when I inspected them on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
arrival at Rafa. They were miles ahead, physically, of
the men who joined the battalion in England&mdash;in fact I
do not believe that there was a unit in the whole of the
E.E.F. that held such a fine-looking body of men. Because
they were untrained and had no idea of discipline,
these hefty youths were constantly in trouble for committing
breaches of military rules and regulations. They
simply did not understand soldiering or what it meant.
In this way I got to know the majority of them fairly
well. We had many interesting meetings at "office
hour." Of course, in dealing with these volunteers, I
never forgot that the faults they were guilty of were, in
great measure, due to lack of training, and I dealt with
them accordingly. Their military offences were not
grave, just the delinquencies that must be expected of
recruits, because they are recruits.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is always a danger to have a battalion,
supposed to be at any moment ready to take the field,
swamped with some 800 raw untrained men.</p>

<p>I felt so strongly on this question, and so clearly foresaw
the inevitable end, that having failed to move the
authorities myself, I cast about me to see where I could
look for help and sympathy in the difficult situation in
which I was placed; the only possible man who might
be able to do something was the Acting-Chairman of the
Zionist Commission then in Palestine. It will be
remembered that, soon after the famous Balfour Declaration,
Dr. Weizmann, the President of the Zionist
Organisation, was sent out at the head of a Commission
to investigate conditions and safeguard Jewish interests
in Palestine. Dr. Weizmann was received by H.M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the King before his departure from England, and came
out armed with strong letters from the Prime Minister
and Mr. Balfour to General Allenby. Dr. Weizmann
spent some time doing useful work in Palestine, and was
then recalled to England in connection with the Zionist
policy then before our Government. The mantle of Dr.
Weizmann eventually fell on Dr. Eder, and to him I
now applied myself, as it was a matter of the greatest
importance that no undeserved slur should fall upon the
Jewish Battalion.</p>

<p>Like myself, however, Dr. Eder was unable to effect
anything.</p>

<p>I felt very strongly that the whole attitude adopted
towards the Jewish Battalions was unworthy of British
traditions of fair play. It is of course possible that
General Allenby did not know of the treatment to which
we were subjected by certain members of his Staff and
other underlings, for naturally only the greater questions
would come before him. If he had known he would
surely never have countenanced the jeopardising of the
good name of any battalion in the E.E.F. by swamping
it with over 800 raw recruits who, owing to the "exigencies
of the service," had to be put on trained soldiers'
duties the moment they joined.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was unable to let him know of our
dilemma, for the Chief of Staff, Major-General Louis
Jean Bols, had forbidden me to address the Commander-in-Chief
direct, and apparently the appeals which I had
made on this question never reached a sympathetic
quarter.</p>

<p>As I have already said, I had been ill from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
time we began operations in the Jordan Valley and was
now reduced to a skeleton, but by careful dieting I had
hoped to weather the storm and had so far managed to
keep out of Hospital.</p>

<p>Thinking that a few days change would improve my
health I applied for leave and went to Cairo. While I
was there I happened by chance to meet Captain Salaman
in the street, and he was so shocked at my appearance
that he straightway convoyed me off to Nasrieh
Hospital, where I was taken in hand by Captain
Wallace, R.A.M.C. In a couple of weeks he had me
well enough to be transferred to the beautiful Convalescent
Home at Sirdariah, where the matron and staff of
nurses were kindness and consideration personified; a
short spell in this well-managed institution completed my
cure, at the end of which I rejoined the battalion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Return of the Anzacs.</span></div>


<p>About this time the battalion was inspected by the
G.O.C. Lines of Communication, and the following
is what he wrote of the impression we made on him:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters,<br />
Palestine Lines of Communication,</span><br />
</div>
<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">8th January, 1919</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>I was very glad to inspect your battalion and I
was much struck with the soldierly appearance
presented by the men.</p>

<div class="right">
(Signed) E. W. <span class="smcap">Broadbent</span>,<br />
General Officer Commanding P.L. of C.<br />
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Isolated as we were on the edge of the desert we
found life at Rafa somewhat dull and dreary. Sandstorms
were the bane of one's life there; a "Khamsin"
or hot wind would blow for days at a time, enveloping
the place in a cloud of fine sand and making life one long
misery while it lasted. One's eyes, nose, and throat
got choked up, while every morsel of food was full of
grit. "Khamsin" is Arabic for fifty; the hot wind
is supposed to blow for that number of days but, thank
Heaven, it rarely lasted more than a week on end at
Rafa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no other troops in the place to vary the
deadly monotony. True, there were some Engineers
of the Railway Operating Division, but we found them
somewhat selfish, for although they had an excellent
Concert Hall they refused our Concert Party permission
to use it. Even at Rafa the few underlings on the Staff
took their cue from above and did what they could to
make our life as uncomfortable as possible, until they
came to know us better.</p>

<p>It can be imagined, therefore, with what joyful feelings
we saw our old friends of the Anzac Division march
into Rafa and make it their headquarters.</p>

<p>Since we had parted from the Anzacs in Gilead we
had seen nothing of them, but we knew that they had
been camped in the green fields and pleasant pastures
surrounding the Jewish Colony of Richon-le-Zion. The
slings and arrows of misfortunes removed them from
these sylvan surroundings, but whatever ill wind blew
them to Rafa it was a godsend for us.</p>

<p>In these piping days of Peace, now that we were
among our old friends once more, there was horse-racing,
hunting, tournaments and boxing galore, while
an enterprising kinema man came and photographed
camp scenes and groups of officers and men.</p>

<p>In the sand dunes around Rafa many ancient coins
were to be found, and General Chaytor himself could
always be relied on to head a hunt for these and other
relics of antiquity. We never failed to find some objects
of interest&mdash;bits of glazed pottery, glass, beads, pins,
bangles, rings, etc. Every time there was a storm the
top sand would get blown away and we could always
go and make fresh finds in the ground we had already
explored, and great was the competition as to who
should discover the best specimens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><br />GROUP OF OFFICERS AT RAFA</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>The General had the eye of a lynx for such things, and
it was rarely indeed that anyone else had a look in while
he was to the fore. He discovered some very beautiful
old mosaics buried at Shellal, and these he had carefully
sketched and artistically coloured, exactly as they were
in the original. I was very pleased when he kindly presented
me with a copy.</p>

<p>The rolling downs round about us were dotted here
and there with the graves of fallen Australian and New
Zealand soldiers, and, riding as I often did with General
Chaytor, he would explain the operations which took
place when the British first entered Palestine at this
point. He gave me many vivid descriptions of the part
which his Brigade had taken in the overthrow of the
Turks at the Battle of Rafa.</p>

<p>The General had a very narrow escape on that
occasion. In the middle of the battle, when he was
galloping from one position to another, attended only by
his orderly, he came suddenly upon a concealed trench
full of Turks. Fortunately they thought he was at the
head of a Squadron, so threw up their hands and surrendered.
The General left his orderly to march off
the prisoners and galloped on to conduct the fight elsewhere.</p>

<p>We motored over to Gaza once and spent a most
interesting day there.</p>

<p>From Ali Muntar, a hill to the east of the town, which
had been the General's headquarters in the first battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of Gaza, he described the whole situation. From this
point almost every bit of Gaza and the surrounding
country could easily be seen.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that at the first battle we
claimed a victory which history has not since been able
to verify, for we retired in hot haste on Rafa; but it is
said that, if there had only been a little more push and
go in the high command that day, Gaza would have been
ours.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was ours at one time, for part
of General Chaytor's brigade was right in the town,
where they captured some hundreds of prisoners and a
couple of guns which they turned on the Turks in Gaza
with considerable effect, sighting their strange new
pieces at point blank range by peeping through the bore
of the guns.</p>

<p>The Turks were everywhere beginning to throw up
the sponge, when, alas, the British Force was suddenly
ordered to retire because a Turkish relieving column
was seen approaching in the distance; but if only the
British Division, which all this time had been
held in reserve, had been thrust forward to intercept
this column, tired, thirsty, and done up as it was, we
could, no doubt, have shattered it and won a complete
victory.</p>

<p>General Chaytor was ordered to retire somewhat early
in the afternoon, but, as he had a squadron right in the
town, and many wounded men in advanced positions,
he waited until nightfall before withdrawing, taking with
him all his wounded, and also the Turkish prisoners and
captured guns. No matter who had the "wind up"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that day, it certainly was not General Chaytor or his
Brigade.</p>

<p>The second battle of Gaza was, of course, a terrible
fiasco, in which we were repulsed and lost thousands of
men to no purpose.</p>

<p>On another occasion I motored, with Colonel Croll,
R.A.M.C., of the Anzacs, to Beersheba. It was at this
point that General Allenby made a successful thrust
when he first took command in Palestine, and from that
day to this he has never looked back. The Anzacs and
the Australian Mounted Division in this attack made a
wide turning movement, outflanked Beersheba, burst
suddenly in upon Tel el Saba, some three miles to the
east of it, galloped the Turkish trenches, and poured into
Beersheba at one end in a whirlwind of dust and storm
while the Turks skedaddled out of it as fast as ever they
could run from the other end, and made for the shelter
of the foothills towards Hebron.</p>

<p>The New Zealanders say that they were responsible
for the capture of Tel el Saba, for it was they who outflanked
it; while the Australians assured me that it was
they who had stormed it at a mad gallop. At all events
it was a decisive victory for the Australians and New
Zealanders (for both took part in it), and as fine a piece
of mounted work as had been done so far during the war.
Dash, energy, and initiative were shown in a very high
degree by all ranks engaged.</p>

<p>In the little cemetery at Beersheba I visited the grave
of Major Markwell, one of the bravest officers who fell
that day.</p>

<p>We also paid a visit to the site of Old Beersheba, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
were greatly interested in peering down into the well
dug at this celebrated place by the Patriarch Abraham.</p>

<p>From Beersheba we motored to Gaza along the former
Turkish front; every inch of the way had been fortified
and turned into a maze of trenches, with formidable
redoubts here and there throughout the line.</p>

<p>Once Beersheba was captured, the heart was taken
out of the Turkish resistance, though they put up some
stiff fighting before they were dislodged, especially at
Atawineh, a strong redoubt near the centre of the
position.</p>

<p>After the capture of Beersheba, Lieutenant-Colonel
S. F. Newcombe, D.S.O., R.E., dashed northwards
with part of the Camel Corps, to cut off the Turks retreating
on the Beersheba-Hebron Road. He reached
a point within a few miles of the latter place, but was
surrounded by six battalions of the enemy. He held out
gallantly for three days; but at last, when he had exhausted
all his ammunition and suffered heavy casualties,
he was obliged to surrender.</p>

<p>Fate holds in its lap many surprises. If Colonel
Newcombe had not been captured that day he would
undoubtedly, with ordinary luck, have won distinction
and rank, but there was another and better prize
awaiting him at Constantinople, for, while he was a
prisoner and convalescing in that city, he met a
charming young lady who, at great personal risk, helped
him to escape from the clutches of the Turk, and afterwards
became his wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">A Red-Letter Day.</span></div>


<p>Soon after the Anzac Division came to Rafa,
General Chaytor expressed a wish to inspect the
battalion and present decorations to those officers,
N.C.O.s, and men who had won them while under his
command.</p>

<p>It was a gloriously sunny afternoon, and every available
man in the battalion was on parade when General
Chaytor, accompanied by Colonel Bruxner and Major
Anderson, rode on to the review ground and took the
"General Salute."</p>

<p>The battalion was then formed up on three sides of a
square; the officers, N.C.O.s, and men to be decorated
stood in the centre, and as each was called out to have
the coveted honour pinned to his breast, his deeds were
recounted to the assembled troops.</p>

<p>Captain T. B. Brown won the Military Cross and bar
for having gallantly led many a dangerous reconnaissance
into the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Fligelstone was also decorated with the
Military Cross for good, gallant, and dangerous work
successfully performed while he was acting as machine-gun
officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Cameron and Lieutenant Bullock both
won Military Crosses and bars for good and gallant
patrol and intelligence work in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>Corporal Bloom, Lance-Corporal Elfman, and
Privates Angel and Robinson were all decorated with
the Military Medal for various gallant acts performed in
the Mellahah, and during the recent operations.</p>

<p>Major Neill had the D.S.O. conferred on him for his
able handling of the battalion while it was under his command
in "Patterson's Column," Captain Leadley
received the Military Cross for his good Staff work, and
Company Sergeant-Major Plant won the D.C.M. for
special services rendered by him during the whole time
we were in the fighting line.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentation the General made the
following address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Colonel Patterson, Officers, N.C.O.s, and men
of the 38th Jewish Battalion Royal Fusiliers, I
have specially come here to-day, first of all to
present decorations to the officers and men who
have won them in the recent operations under my
command.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to tell you how sorry I am that I
was not able to put you in the Van in the advance
on Es Salt. I wished that you had been there,
and I wanted you to be there, but the Indian
Infantry and other units were in a more favourable
position from which to spring off, while you were
still entangled miles to the northward in the heavy
sandhills of the Jordan Valley. In any case, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>had you been in the Van you would have seen but
little fighting, for the mounted men got well to the
front and were able to effect the capture of Es Salt
and Amman before the Infantry could possibly come
up.</p>

<p>I am pleased to be able to tell you, however,
that I was particularly struck with your good work
on the Mellahah front, and by your gallant capture
of the Umm esh Shert Ford and defeat of the
Turkish rearguard when I gave you the order to
go, for I was then enabled to push my mounted men
over the Jordan at that crossing, and so you contributed
materially to the capture of Es Salt and of
the guns and other material which fell to our share;
to the capture of Amman; the cutting of the Hedjaz
Railway, and the destruction of the 4th Turkish
Army, which helped considerably towards the great
victory won at Damascus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I briefly thanked the General for his praise of the battalion,
and a march past the decorated officers and men
concluded the pleasant ceremony. It was indeed a Red-Letter
Day for the battalion.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above what really good work
was done by the Jewish Battalion, and how much it was
appreciated by the one man who was in a position to
judge of our fighting abilities by actual experience in
the field.</p>

<p>Yet all mention of Jewish Troops was deliberately
suppressed by the Staff at G.H.Q. True, Jewish
Troops were mentioned in official despatches all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the world, but the part of these despatches relating to
Jewish Troops was never allowed to appear in the Palestinian
and Egyptian papers. This naturally upset and
humiliated both Jewish troops and the Jewish population
generally, for it gave outsiders the impression that we had
failed to do our duty, whereas, on the contrary, the
Jewish Battalion had done extraordinarily good work
for England. It would, therefore, have been only mere
justice and fair play if it had received recognition in the
local Egyptian and Palestinian Press, but it was rigidly
excluded from all mention by what the <i>Times</i> truthfully
branded as "the most incompetent, the most inept, and
the most savagely ruthless censorship in any country
under British control."</p>

<p>This omission was especially noted by all when the
Commander-in-Chief in his speech at Cairo, in December,
1918, mentioned all nationalities who fought under
his command, including Armenians and West Indians,
but maintained a stony silence on the doings of Jewish
Troops in Palestine. Coming on the top of all our persecution,
this was most marked.</p>

<p>The following is indeed in his despatch published in
England, which must by some fluke or other have
dodged the Censor:</p>

<blockquote>

the Jordan at Umm es Shert, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 22nd September, the
38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers captured the bridgehead
at Umm es Shert.</p>

<p>Of the fighting troops, all have taken their
share and have carried out what was required of
them.</p>

<p>I will bring to notice the good fighting qualities
shown by the newer units. These include ...
the 38th and 39th (Jewish) Battalions of the Royal
Fusiliers.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief also wrote in reply to a
letter of congratulation which he received from the
Secretary of the Zionist Organization of America:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge your letter....</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear that the Jewish Regiment
did consistently good work....
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I received letters of congratulations from many
prominent people, but the most valued of all was from
that wonderful and truly great man, Theodore Roosevelt.
I only received this letter, written three weeks
before his lamented death, towards the end of March&mdash;over
two months after he had passed away. It had been
sent to France in error, and wandered in and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
amongst the different armies there until somebody
noticed that it had "E.E.F." on the address, and sent
it on to Palestine:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right"><span class="smcap">11th December, 1918.</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colonel Patterson</span>,</p>

<p>I most heartily congratulate you on leading in
what was not only one of the most important, but
one of the most dramatic incidents in the whole War.
To have the sons of Israel smite Ammon "hip and
thigh" under your leadership is something worth
while.</p>

<p>As for my own loss, the death of my son
Quentin was very bitter, but it would have been far
more bitter if he had been a hand's breadth behind
his friends in entering the war. Two of my other
sons have been wounded, one of them crippled.
The other wounded one has recovered, and as
Lieutenant-Colonel is now commanding his regiment
on the march towards the Rhine. Kermit is
Captain of Artillery, having first served in Mesopotamia,
and then under Pershing in the Argonne
fight.</p>

<p>Although the Staff denied us any local credit, our
Zionist friends in the country knew what good work the
battalion had done, and we were glad to receive the
following official letter from the Zionist Commission:</p>

the operations that we hope have finally reopened

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Jewish Soldiers are Forbidden to Enter the
Holy City.</span></div>


<p>On the 24th February, 1919, I was appointed to the
command of "Rafa Area." The "Area" was
rather an extensive one; it included nearly the whole of
the Sinai Desert to the south, and Palestine to the north,
almost as far as Bir Salem, while to the east it went
beyond Beersheba to the Arabian Desert. There were
over 150 miles of railway to guard, and the Bedouins had
to be constantly watched and checked, or they would
have played all sorts of pranks with the line. Constant
patrols had to be maintained, and every day provided a
fresh problem for solution. The fresh-water pipe line
from Egypt ran alongside the railway and, of course,
the wandering and thirsty Ishmaelite thought nothing of
smashing this in order to get a drink for himself and his
camel. We had to be on the alert all the time and nip
these little enterprises of our friendly Allies in the bud.
They did not hesitate to attempt to loot the supply stores
of flour, forage, etc., stored at Rafa, and our sentries
had many lively little encounters with these marauders,
and I must say that the wily rascals took their chance of
a bullet quite casually. While the Anzac Division was
with us I felt quite easy in my mind about being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
keep these slippery customers in check, but it was quite
"another pair of shoes" when the Anzacs were
hurriedly called away to suppress the disorders in Egypt.</p>

<p>In addition to the 38th Battalion, I had some Indian
Infantry holding Gaza, and some South African troops
holding El Arish. As demobilization progressed these
were withdrawn and the whole of this great area was, in
the end, solely garrisoned and guarded by the Jewish
Battalion. They performed their arduous duties extraordinarily
well. They were scattered up and down the
line in small posts, often in the midst of Arab villages
and Bedouin camps, yet there was never any friction
between Jew and Arab, although here was a likely setting
for it, if there had been any real ill-feelings animating
either side; but, as a matter of fact, the Jew and Arab
got on wonderfully well together all over Palestine, and
had worked amicably side by side for over forty years in
the Jewish colonies.</p>

<p>When the Egyptian Nationalist riots started the
Military Governor of El Arish feared an outbreak in
this large Arab town, so I had to send reinforcements
to the garrison there under the command of Captain
Jaffe, an officer of the battalion. Aeroplanes flew
up from the Aerodrome at Heliopolis, and swooping
low over El Arish put the fear of the Lord into the inhabitants;
this demonstration, and the great personal influence
of the Military Governor, Colonel Parker, kept
these people quiet, and they gave us no trouble whatever.</p>

<p>Later on we had to guard a number of political
prisoners who were sent up from Egypt as a result of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
disturbances there, and this added considerably to the
heavy work of the battalion.</p>

<p>At Rafa there was an enormous Ammunition Depôt,
covering acres of ground, and this was a constant source
of anxiety, and had to be guarded on all sides, night and
day. While the Jewish troops held it in custody nothing
untoward happened, but, after they were removed, by
some evil chance the whole place was blown up with
considerable loss of life.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the heavy work exacted from the battalion,
there was one great consolation for the men. No
petty discrimination could now be practised against them
within my jurisdiction, and although I had five Staff
Officers under my command, I found them quite good
fellows, and willing to do all in their power to do the
right thing by the Jewish troops.</p>

<p>Discrimination against Jews was, however, still shown
in other quarters. Early in April the men were considerably
upset on the receipt of orders from G.H.Q. that no
Jewish soldier would be allowed to enter Jerusalem
during the Passover; the order ran thus:</p>

<p>"The walled city (of Jerusalem) is placed out of
bounds to all <i>Jewish</i> soldiers from the 14th to the
22nd April, inclusive."</p>

<p>I cannot conceive a greater act of provocation to
Jewish soldiers than this, or a greater insult. The days
during which they were prohibited from entering Jerusalem
were the days of the Passover. Think of it!
Jewish soldiers for the first time in their lives in Palestine
and barred from the Temple Wall of Jerusalem during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Passover! Only a Jew can really understand what it
meant to these men, and the great strain it put on their
discipline and loyalty.</p>

<p>How provocative and insulting this order was will be
better understood when it is realized that the majority of
the population of Jerusalem is Jewish, and, therefore,
there could have been no possible reason for excluding
Jewish troops belonging to a British unit, while other
British troops were freely admitted, more especially as
the conduct of the Jewish soldiers was, at all times,
exemplary.</p>

<p>Not since the days of the Emperor Hadrian had such
a humiliating decree been issued.</p>

<p>However, to make up somewhat for the action of the
authorities, I made arrangements for the Passover to
be observed at Rafa with all the joy and ceremony
usually attending that great Feast of the Jewish People.
At considerable cost we provided unleavened bread, as
well as meat and wine&mdash;all strictly "Kosher." As we
were nearly 2,000 strong at this time, the catering for
the feast had to be most carefully gone into, and Lieut.
Jabotinsky, Lieut. Lazarus, and the Rev. L. A.
Falk did yeoman service in providing for all needs.
It was a wonderful sight when we all sat down
together and sang the Hagadah on the edge of the Sinai
desert.</p>

<p>The Zionist Commission and Miss Berger, an
American Zionist, helped us materially with funds, and
our friends in England did likewise. The Acting Chairman
of the Zionist Commission sent me the following
letter for the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>My dear Colonel,</p>

<p>May I request, in the name of the Zionist Commission,
that you have this letter read to the men of
your battalion at their Seder Service.</p>

<p>The Commission is glad to be the means of aiding
them in celebrating our Pesach, the Feast of Deliverance,
and we trust that it will bring them all
great joy. We have hopes now that our age-long
prayers will soon be realized, and it should be a
source of pride and happiness to them to know that
they have contributed by their courage and their
sacrifices toward its fulfilment. The Commission
speaks in the name of the Zionist Organization in
expressing to them the thanks of the nation for the
devoted services they have rendered and are rendering,
in the service of the liberty-loving nation,
Great Britain, to which they have sworn fidelity,
and to our people of Israel for whose future glory
they have been willing to sacrifice their lives. The
splendid part they have played, and will continue to
play, will ever be remembered as a bright spot in
the long history of our ancient people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>As Rafa was just over the border of Palestine, and
therefore in the "Galuth," the Feast had to be kept for
eight days. Many of the men thought that, as we were
only a matter of yards from the boundary, I would on
the eighth day issue leavened bread, which some of them
were already hankering after, but this I would not hear
of, and from that day forth I was considered the strictest
Jew in the battalion!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Great Boxing Competition.</span></div>


<p>There was a great deal of unrest and unhealthy
excitement during demobilization, so to keep the
troops interested and amused, competitions were got up
throughout the E.E.F. in Boxing, Football, Cricket,
and sports of all kinds.</p>

<p>Soon after we reached Rafa a programme of coming
sporting events was circulated from G.H.Q.</p>

<p>Naturally, in a fighting army like the British, the
greatest interest of all was taken in the Boxing competition,
and the 38th Royal Fusiliers entered with keenness
for all events.</p>

<p>By the terms of the contest teams could be chosen
from Brigades, or even from Divisions, but, as we belonged
to no Brigade or Division, we could only choose
our men from our own battalion, which was of course a
considerable handicap.</p>

<p>However, I considered that this was a grand opportunity
of proving that men picked from this Jewish Battalion,
if properly trained, would be able to hold their
own against any team that might be brought against
them from other units, or brigades, or even divisions, of
the British Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>I therefore formed a Sports Committee, collected my
team of boxers, bought them boxing gloves, punch balls,
etc., and despatched them with a trainer to El Arish,
some 30 miles away, on the shores of the Mediterranean.
There they raced, chased, boxed, bathed, danced, and
were generally licked into condition by Sergeant
Goldberg, the boxing instructor to the battalion.</p>

<p>In order to weed out the weaker teams so that only the
very best should appear at the finals in Cairo, the contest
was subdivided into four great tournaments: one for
all the troops in Egypt, another for all the troops in
Palestine, the third for all the troops in Syria, and the
fourth for the best team among the Australians and New
Zealanders. At my inspection of the 38th team, just
before the tournament, I was much impressed with our
prospects of success, for the men boxed wonderfully
well.</p>

<p>We were all agog with excitement, and I may say with
hope, when the great day for the Palestine Championship
arrived and our men stepped inside the ropes at
Kantara, surrounded by thousands of onlookers.</p>

<p>There was some splendid fighting, but I cannot go
into the details of it here. It is sufficient to say
that we defeated all comers, won five gold medals, and
emerged as the Champions of Palestine, with the right,
therefore, of representing it in the great Cairo tournament
for the Championship of the E.E.F. Could anything
be more fitting? Jewish soldiers as champions of
Palestine.</p>

<p>It can be imagined what jubilation there was in camp
when our team returned to Rafa, and the ringing cheers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
which roared out when, at one of our concerts, I presented
the gold medals to the victors, whose names are
as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="left">Bantam-weight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Private Goldfarb.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The first round of this essentially British form of sport
had been fought and won by the despised Jewish
Battalion!</p>

<p>There yet remained the great contest at Cairo, where
we would have to meet the champions of Egypt, and of
the Australian forces, and of Syria.</p>

<p>Real hard training was once more the order of the day
at El Arish, and I can guarantee that no fitter men than
ours stepped into the ring at Cairo on that glorious night
of the 13th March, when the first rounds of the championship
were fought in the presence of thousands of
spectators from all parts.</p>

<p>Again the Jewish Battalion won practically every
contest, defeating all its opponents among the British
Regiments. Eventually, it was left in to fight out the
final round of the Championship for the whole of the
E.E.F. with the Australians, who on their side had
defeated their opponents.</p>

<p>It was a memorable night (the Ides of March) when
this final contest took place. Excitement and feeling
ran very high round the ring, and there was some magnificent
fighting on both sides. In the end it was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that the Jewish Battalion had tied for victory with the
Australians.</p>

<p>A decision, however, was given against us, on the
grounds that we had not entered an officer of the battalion
in the team. As a matter of fact, I <i>had</i> entered an
officer of the battalion with the teams, but the judge
(who was a British General, not an Australian) said that
my team officer was only "attached" to the 38th for
duty, and therefore could not be claimed as belonging to
the battalion. Of course practically every officer in the
battalion was only "attached" for duty, but there&mdash;I
suppose it really would not have been the "right thing"
for one Jewish Battalion to have defeated the whole of
the Egyptian Expeditionary Force!</p>

<p>In football the men were almost equally good, and we
were good runners-up for the Championship of
Palestine.</p>

<p>In cricket also&mdash;that essentially English game&mdash;the
battalion acquitted itself most creditably under Captain
Pope's tuition, defeating all comers in the Bir Salem
matches, with the exception of the Flying Corps; while
our Americans were, of course, unrivalled at base ball,
at which they were real experts. They often gave exhibitions
of their skill, to the great delight of all those
who had never before seen the game played.</p>

<p>Our Concert Party was also still well to the fore, and
easily took first place in Palestine&mdash;its only possible rival
being that of the 39th Battalion. I had only got to let it
be known that Tchaikov&mdash;our first violinist&mdash;would give
a performance to draw a crowd big enough to pack our
concert tent four times over. In the end a covetous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
man succeeded in wheedling Tchaikov away from us.
Colonel Storrs, the Governor of Jerusalem, begged him
from me so persuasively that I could not refuse him,
more especially as it was to Tchaikov's advantage to
settle in the Holy City, where he took up the post of
Director of the School of Music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Bir Salem&mdash;An Exciting Race.</span></div>


<p>Early in May we were transferred from Rafa to
Bir Salem. The advance party moved on the
6th, and on the 10th the Battalion Headquarters followed,
and took over duties from the 7th Indian Infantry
Brigade, which was then sent to Haifa.</p>

<p>We were replaced at Rafa by the 40th (Jewish) Battalion
Royal Fusiliers, which was now composed mainly
of the Palestinian youths recruited by Major James de
Rothschild and Lieutenant Lipsey. For a time they
were commanded by Lieut.-Colonel F. D. Samuel
D.S.O., but he left for England while the battalion was
doing garrison duty at Haifa.</p>

<p>The command then fell to Colonel Scott, a most conscientious
officer, and a man in full sympathy with
Zionist aspirations. While at Rafa he had a most
anxious time owing to the unwise action of the military
authorities. The men of the 40th Battalion had enlisted
for service in Palestine only, but the local Staff ignored
this definite contract and ordered part of the battalion to
Cyprus. As this was a breach of their terms of enlistment,
the men refused to go, and in the end the officials
had to climb down and cancel all their unjust orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Why did the Staff, when they knew all about this special
contract for service in Palestine only, drive this excellent
battalion almost to the verge of mutiny? There were
many other battalions available for Cyprus.</p>

<p>Happily, Colonel Scott brought his men safely
through the rough time at Rafa, and he served on with
them until December, 1919, when the 40th was merged
in the 38th Battalion.</p>

<p>All through the early days of May I saw chalked up
everywhere&mdash;on the Railway Station, signal boxes,
workshops, on the engines, trucks, and carriages&mdash;the
mystic words, "Remember the 11th May."</p>

<p>This was, of course, the date on which all soldiers,
rightly or wrongly, believed themselves entitled to their
release, because it was six months after the Armistice
granted to the Germans on November 11th, 1918.</p>

<p>I heard it rumoured that there was a conspiracy on
foot in the E.E.F. for a general mutiny on that day, and
found that men from other units had endeavoured to
seduce my battalion from its duty.</p>

<p>On learning this, I at once determined to nip the
attempt in the bud, and so made it my business to speak
to every man in the battalion, and on every isolated post,
impressing upon them the responsibility which rested on
their shoulders as Jews, and urging them on no account
to be led away by the hot-heads in other units.</p>

<p>I told them that British troops could perhaps afford to
mutiny, but Jewish troops, while serving England,
never.</p>

<p>I am proud to be able to state that not a man of my
battalion failed on the 11th May, but just "carried on"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as usual. Mutinies took place elsewhere, and thousands
of British soldiers at Kantara ran riot and had the place
in a blaze. However, the matter was hushed up, concessions
were made, the mutineers were not punished,
so far as I know, and things gradually became normal
again.</p>

<p>Our effective strength when we left Rafa was 15
officers and 1,300 other ranks. Our duties at Bir Salem,
Ludd, and Ramleh were exceptionally heavy, the men
being very often on duty three nights in a week, and
when they were off guard duties they were immediately
put on to prisoner of war escorts, etc., as there was a
very large Turkish and German Prisoners of War Camp
at Ludd.</p>

<p>At Bir Salem we were attached to the 3rd (Lahore)
Division, under the command of General Hoskin. It is
a great pleasure to me to be able to state here that this
officer and his Staff gave us a very hearty and cordial
welcome to Bir Salem, and did everything possible for
our comfort and welfare.</p>

<p>I look upon General Hoskin with his Staff as the
one bright luminary amidst the gloomy British constellations
among whom we were continually revolving!
What an immense difference it makes to the feelings of
a regiment or a battalion when it is known that the Staff
are out to help and assist (as is their proper function),
instead of to crab and block everything; in the former
case one is ready to work the skin off one's bones, while
in the latter everybody's back is up, with the result that
co-ordination and happy working is impossible.</p>

<p>This was a happy time for the young lions of Judah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
for the G.O.C. and his staff were out to help and assist
in every possible way. We were not then aware of all
the trials and tribulations that awaited us on the departure
of General Hoskins and his excellent staff&mdash;sahibs
to a man.</p>

<p>The battalion owes a deep debt of gratitude to Mr.
Jessop, the capable secretary of the Y.M.C.A. in
Egypt, who supplied us with a magnificent marquee,
completely furnished with tables, chairs, forms, lamps,
etc., etc. Only for this gift from the Y.M.C.A. we
should have been very badly off indeed, for we were
camped on a sandy waste without huts or any conveniences
which other troops in our neighbourhood fortunately
possessed.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of note that, although the wealthy
Jews of Cairo and Alexandria contributed generously to
the E. E. F. Comforts Fund, not a single article of any
kind was ever sent to the Jewish Battalion to cheer them
in their desolate surroundings. We asked for gramophones,
etc., but got nothing&mdash;not even a reply!</p>

<p>There were compensations, however, at Bir Salem.
We had many interesting visitors who came to cheer us
in our camp in the sands, among others the Haham
Bashi (Grand Rabbi of Jaffa) and the famous Dutch poet
Dr. de Haan. I remember that the latter took great
interest in a pet monkey which belonged to one of the
men of the battalion, but the quaint-looking little animal
showed little respect for the poet, for she evinced a
decided desire to leave the print of her teeth in his finger
as a souvenir of his visit.</p>

<p>We were always kindly and hospitably received by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
citizens of Jaffa, headed by Mr. Bezalel Jaffe, and by
those of Richon-le-Zion, headed by Mr. Gluskin, when
we visited those colonies.</p>

<p>While stationed here I spent many a pleasant evening
chatting with Mr. Aharoni, a well-known naturalist, who
lives at Rechoboth. There is perhaps no man in all
Syria and Palestine with such a wide knowledge of the
flora and fauna of those countries, and he gave me many
interesting accounts of his adventures among the
Bedouins while in quest of specimens for various
European museums.</p>

<p>When the Great War broke out he had secured two
live ostrich chicks, new to science, and these he had
hoped to send alive to England. However, when the
pinch for food came there was none for the ostriches, so
they had to be killed; they were stuffed, and may now
be seen at Lord Rothschild's famous museum at Tring
Park, Hertfordshire. This story of the ostrich
chicks was related to me by Mr. Aharoni while I was
celebrating with him the "Feast of Tabernacles,"
under the shade of "boughs of goodly trees, branches
of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows
of the brook," and we did greatly rejoice, for the Feast
was a goodly one, and the pottage of Gevereth Aharoni
was such as my soul loved.</p>

<p>About this time many military Race Meetings were
organized in different parts of Palestine, Syria, and
Egypt, and officers were encouraged to take part in them
and get the men interested in the sport, so as to take
their thoughts away from the absorbing topic of demobilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 5th June a Race Meeting was held at Surafend,
a few miles from Bir Salem, and as we were all expected
to support the programme, I entered my charger Betty
for one of the events.</p>

<p>Betty was a beautiful dark-brown creature, but somewhat
skittish and wayward, like many of her sex. I
knew her little ways and how to humour her to perfection,
and she always gave me of her best. More than once
she managed to slip her fastenings in the horse lines,
and used her freedom to gallop off to my tent, where
she would thrust her head through the doorway; then,
apparently satisfied, she would fly back to her place in
the lines.</p>

<p>She appeared at times to see something not visible to
the human eye, because, now and again, when cantering
quickly along, for no apparent reason she would suddenly
bound aside as if the Devil himself had scared her
out of her wits.</p>

<p>The 3rd Lahore Division had at this time on its Staff
an able and energetic sportsman, Major Pott, of the
Indian Cavalry; this officer provided an excellent programme
and ran the meeting without a hitch.</p>

<p>It was a lovely sunny afternoon, and thousands of
people flocked to the course, soldiers from the camps
round about, civilians from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and the
surrounding colonies; the Arabs and Bedouins also sent
a very strong contingent.</p>

<p>In the race for which I had entered Betty (I called
her Betty in memory of another Betty, also beautiful and
with a turn of speed!) a full score of horses went to the
post, and I, unfortunately, drew the outside place. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
therefore felt that unless I got well away at the start,
and secured sufficient lead to enable me to cross to the
inside, I would have but a poor chance of winning, for,
about half-way down the course, there was a tremendous
bend to negotiate. I was lucky enough to jump away
in front, and, soon finding myself well ahead, swerved
across to the inside, where I hugged the rails. For
three parts of the way round Betty made the running,
but soon after we came into the straight for home I eased
her a bit and was passed by Major Pott, who was riding
a well-known mare, also, strange to say, called Betty.
At the distance the Major was quite a length ahead of
me, but I felt that there was still plenty of go in my
Betty, so I called upon the game little mare to show her
mettle. Gradually she forged herself forward until there
was but a head between them, and for the last dozen
strides the two Bettys raced forward dead level amid
the frantic roars of the crowd, all shouting, "Go on,
Betty! Go on, Betty!" We both rode for all we
were worth, my Betty straining every nerve to defeat
her namesake, and finally, amid terrific cheering, by the
shortest of heads, Betty won&mdash;but, alas, it was the other
Betty!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Damascus.</span></div>


<p>Towards the end of June I took part in the
military races at Alexandria, and from the "home
town" of Hypatia I took ship and went to Beyrout&mdash;a
lovely seaport, nestling under the mighty and magnificent
Lebanon. Here I was most hospitably entertained by
my friends, the Bustroses. From the balcony of her
palatial residence Madame Bustros enjoys a view second
to none in the world, and every imaginable fruit and
flower grows and blooms on her estate. Beyrout is undoubtedly
a place of milk and honey, and is unquestionably
within the Biblical boundaries of the Promised
Land. Ezekiel xlvii., 17, states: "and the border from
the sea shall be Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus
and the north northward and the border of Hamath."
This was the northern boundary assigned to Israel and
was actually occupied in the days of David and Solomon.</p>

<p>My journey across the Lebanon was one long feast of
the most beautiful scenery in the world. As we topped
the range my last peep of mountain and valley, stretching
away down to Beyrout, hemmed in by the glittering
sea, was like a vision of Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of going to Damascus direct, I branched off
at Ryak and ran up the Bakaa, the valley which stretches
between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon to Baalbek, where
I spent a wonderful time amid the mighty ruins of that
ancient temple to Baal.</p>

<p>Baalbek is the most beautiful and impressive ruin that
it has ever been my good fortune to look upon. Thebes
may exceed it in size, but the wonder of Egypt had not
the effect upon me that was produced when I stood under
the magnificent columns of this great temple to the
heathen god.</p>

<p>I wandered through the vast pile, an insignificant
speck amidst its gigantic pillars and fallen lintels, overthrown
and shattered by the devastating earthquake
which centuries ago wrecked this mighty structure. Who
were the architects who designed it? and who were the
engineers who set on high those stupendous blocks?
Verily there were giants in those days.</p>

<p>At Baalbek railway station I came across one of the
prettiest girls I had seen for many a long day engaged
in selling peaches. She was a Syrian from Lebanon,
which is noted for the beauty of its maidens; I overheard
her companions address this Houri of the mountains as
"Edeen." While I was standing waiting for my train
to arrive a dust storm suddenly sprang up, and when
it was over Edeen sat down and calmly <i>licked</i> the dust
off every peach until they all bloomed again in her
basket; then presently she presented the fruit, fresh and
shining, to the incoming passengers, who eagerly
bought it from the smiling damsel! I need hardly
say that peaches were "off" for me during the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of my trip, for not all sellers were as beautiful as
Edeen!</p>

<p>A few hours in the train took me over the Anti-Lebanon,
and I caught my first glimpse of Damascus,
that most ancient of cities, which I had long desired to
see.</p>

<p>When Mohammed was a camel driver, making a
caravan journey from Medina to Aleppo, the story goes
that he once camped on a hill overlooking Damascus.
His companions asked him to join them and go into the
city but he replied&mdash;"No; Paradise should only be
entered after death!"</p>

<p>I viewed the city from the same spot, but, not being
so sure of my hereafter as was the Prophet, I decided
to take my chance of entering this earthly Paradise while
it offered.</p>

<p>It is rightly described as a pearl set in emeralds.
White mosques, minarets, and cupolas peep dazzlingly
in all directions out of the emerald foliage. Trees,
gardens, and flowers of all kinds abound in this delectable
city, whose charm is enhanced by the murmur of the
many rivers running through it. I, too, like Naaman
the Syrian, found "Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel." The
latter is in the district, and runs some ten miles to the
south of the oldest city in the world. The great Saladin
is buried in Damascus, and of course I made a pilgrimage
to the tomb of this famous warrior.</p>

<p>I like to avoid the caravanserais set up for Europeans
as much as possible when travelling in the East, so that
I may see something of the life of the people. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
way one has many pleasant little adventures, experiences
and remembrances, which give zest to life.</p>

<p>While lunching at a famous Arab restaurant I made
the acquaintance of Dr. Yuseff, a well-known medical
man of Damascus and Beyrout; among other subjects
we talked horses and races, and we became such good
friends that he lent me his fiery, pure-bred Arab steed to
ride while sight-seeing in the neighbourhood&mdash;a sure
token of friendship from this cultured Arab of Syria.</p>

<p>Just on the outskirts of the city on the banks of the
river Barada (the Biblical Abana) I had noticed a
Bedouin camp crowded with good-looking horses, so
thither I went and called on the Sheik of the tribe.
While sitting with the elders in a huge circle, sipping
coffee out of tiny cups, I discovered from their conversation
that my hosts were wandering Kurds, who were just
about to set off for the confines of Persia. I hinted that
I would like to join their caravan, and was immediately
given a warm welcome, but, much as I should have liked
to roam the desert with them, I had to think of my
Jewish Battalion waiting for me at Bir Salem. The
Kurds expressed much interest when I told them I had
to go on a pilgrimage to El Kuds (meaning Jerusalem),
for of course they were good Moslems and reverenced
the Holy City.</p>

<p>On leaving Damascus I travelled down the Hedjaz
Railway as far as Deraa. The moment the ancient
Syrian capital is left the train enters the desert, the home
of the Ishmaelite. These bold rovers, from time immemorial,
have hunted and harried the peaceful traveller
caught toiling through their fastnesses. We were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
molested for the simple reason that troops of cavalry,
British and Indian, were posted at strategic points all
along the railway. A few months later, when we withdrew
from these parts, the Bedouins began their old
games, and took a fierce joy in derailing trains, and robbing,
and even killing, the passengers. In this way a
good friend of mine, Comandante Bianchini, an officer
of the Royal Italian Navy, met his untimely end at the
hands of these desert marauders. Bianchini was deeply
interested in, and worked hard for, the Zionist cause, and
his loss is a sad blow to his many friends. A more
cheery, lovable man never sailed the seas.</p>

<p>We reached Deraa (the ancient Edrei) without incident,
and then branched off westward to Haifa, the
train clambering down and around the precipitous sides
of the Yarmuk Escarpment, past the southern shore of
the Lake of Galilee at Samakh, across the Jordan and
running parallel to it for some miles, then curving upwards
out of the Jordan Valley, into the valley of Jezreel,
which continues into the plain of Esdraelon.</p>

<p>These narrow plains, the heritage of Issachar, sever
the head of Palestine from the body, or, in other words,
separate Galilee from Samaria and Judæa. To use an
Irishism, this neck had been the "Achilles' heel" of
Israel throughout her history. All down the ages armies
from Babylonia, Assyria, Persia, and Egypt have
marched and counter-marched through this fertile belt.
Open passes southward made Samaria an easy prey.
Beisan (the ancient Bethshan), which guards the eastern
end and dominates the passage over the Jordan, was
generally in the hands of the stranger. It was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
neighbourhood of this famous old stronghold that Barak
defeated Sisera, captain of the host of Jaban, king of the
Canaanites&mdash;a victory celebrated in the famous song of
Deborah. It was also in this neighbourhood that
Gideon smote the Midianites. His motto, "The sword
of the Lord and of Gideon," was also the motto of the
Zionists who served England so stoutly in Gallipoli, and
it was a curious coincidence that, just as the Midianites
were routed by the shouting and clamour of Gideon's
three companies, so was the Turkish Army routed by
the Zion mules when, with rattling chains and clattering
hoofs, they stampeded one dark night and galloped
through the Turks as they were creeping stealthily up to
attack the British trenches.</p>

<p>Later on in the military history of the Israelites we
find the Philistines battling for the supremacy on these
plains and overthrowing the army of Israel under their
first King Saul, who, in the bitterness of defeat, and
finding he could not escape, fell on his sword and died on
Mount Gilboa. In the same battle and the same place
the death of Jonathan put an end to his immortal friendship
with David and called forth the famous lament:
"The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places;
how are the mighty fallen."</p>

<p>These stories of the Old Testament flashed vividly
through my mind as we rolled onward through this
historic valley between Mount Gilboa and Beisan on the
left, and the cone-shaped Mount Tabor away on the
right.</p>

<p>Other countries and other scenes were recalled to my
mind when I spied half a dozen beautiful antelope near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
some standing corn, and my thoughts of Africa were
further intensified when I caught a glimpse, on the railway
bank, of a huge black snake, some six feet long,
rapidly darting away out of danger.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, on looking to the north, I saw
Nazareth perched upon a southern Galilean hill-top. We
wound in and out by the brook Kishon, where Elijah
smote the false prophets. Finally we passed along the
mighty shoulder of Mount Carmel into that great natural
anchorage of Haifa, nestling under its shadow; then
southward to Ludd and Bir Salem&mdash;the whole train
journey from Damascus taking some fifteen hours and
giving me an unrivalled feast of Biblical landscapes.</p>

<p>Early in July I visited Acre to take part in the races
there (which proved a fiasco owing to the antics of the
starter), and suddenly found myself close to the dwelling
of the famous Abdul Baha, the exponent of the doctrine
of the Brotherhood of Man. He certainly has a wide
field before him, for at the present moment there seems
to be very little brotherly love in any part of the world!
His particular mission is to unite the peoples of the earth,
and do away with all barriers of race, creed, and
prejudice.</p>

<p>Since Patriarchs, Popes, Archbishops, Mullahs, and
ministers of all creeds have failed to make humanity
realise the necessity of "brotherly love," the League
of Nations would be well advised to adopt the Sage of
Acre and make him President of a "League of
Teachers," pledged to inculcate love for one's fellowmen
as the cardinal feature of his curriculum. One thing
is certain&mdash;the League of Nations will never bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
world into harmony unless the young are taught to love
and help their brothers, irrespective of nationality.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Acre was the town to which
Napoleon laid siege after his wonderful march from
Egypt with about 10,000 French Infantry. This extraordinary
man was able to cross the Sinai desert with his
army, without either roads, railway, or water supply,
capture Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa with ease, and only for
the British Fleet would undoubtedly have added Acre,
and probably all Syria, to his spoils.</p>

<p>Those who have traversed the Sinai sands in a comfortable
railway coach can afford to pay a warm tribute
to this redoubtable warrior, and to the no less redoubtable
Infantry of France.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Among the Philistines.</span></div>


<p>When General Hoskin left Bir Salem to take up
a command in England he was replaced by
Major-General Sir John Shea, under whom we had
served for a short time in the line. If this officer had
not been called elsewhere, I am quite sure that the
regrettable incidents which I shall have to relate would
never have taken place; but, unfortunately, General
Shea was away practically all the time we were attached
to his Division, and a senior Brigadier acted in his
place.</p>

<p>This Brigadier was apparently well aware of the anti-Jewish
attitude taken up by certain members of the
G.H.Q. Staff, and trimmed his sails accordingly, but
unfortunately for himself, as the sequel will show, his
zeal to second their ill-advised efforts carried him to such
lengths that even those influential members whose
policy he was supporting were unable to save him from
the consequences of his own outrageous folly.</p>

<p>No sooner had we come under his command than his
anti-Semitic bias became apparent. Certain areas were
placed out of bounds to "Jewish soldiers" but not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
men in other battalions. Jewish soldiers were so
molested by the Military Police that the only way they
could enjoy a peaceful walk outside camp limits was
by removing their Fusilier badges and substituting
others which they kept conveniently in their pockets
for the purpose. They found that by adopting this
method they were never interfered with by the Military
Police.</p>

<p>Traditional British fair play seemed to have taken
wings as soon as General Z. appeared on the scene. I
repeatedly made official complaints about the way the
men were persecuted, but nothing was done to mend
matters. As a British officer I felt ashamed to hold
my head up in my own camp owing to the unfair
and un-English treatment to which the men were
subjected.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that this attitude of the Staff
made my command anything but an easy one. In the
first place, knowing how all ranks were discriminated
against, no officer or man wished to remain in the battalion.
It was exceedingly difficult under the circumstances
to get the best out of the men. While we were
with the Anzacs, although we suffered exceedingly from
the deadly climate in the desolate Jordan Valley, yet
we were all thoroughly happy, because we were
treated with justice and sympathy by the Staff
and by all other ranks in that famous division. At Bir
Salem, on the contrary, we were anything but a happy
unit.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that before we left Rafa the
battalion had been swamped by about 800 recruits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Physically they were a very fine lot, but, being young
and hailing from the United States, they were a bit wild
and difficult to handle. The moment they joined the
battalion they had to do real hard soldiering, and were
put on outposts and detachments up and down the
country, guarding thousands of prisoners of war, long
stretches of railway line, millions of pounds worth of
munitions, food, ordnance supplies, etc. In fact, so
arduous were these duties that the men had scarcely
more than every alternate night in bed, although it is
the rule in the army that whenever possible every
man should be allowed at least three consecutive nights'
rest.</p>

<p>The great majority of my old trained men of the 38th
had by this time either been demobilised, invalided to
England, or employed on special duties between Cairo
and Aleppo, so that a great part of the heavy duties
which had to be carried out fell on the American recruits.
There was absolutely no time to train these men, and
I consider it was really wonderful that they did so well
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>I know of no more heart-breaking task for a Commanding
Officer than to endeavour to keep a battalion
in a high state of discipline when he is surrounded by
a hostile staff, apparently all out to irritate and humiliate
both officers and men. From "reveille" to "lights
out" it was a case of countering the actions of those in
authority which constantly tended to create discontent
and ill-feeling in our ranks.</p>

<p>I may mention that I had scores of protests from the
men, often daily, owing to the persecution to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
were subjected while we were at Bir Salem. Is it to
be wondered at that, suffering all these things, some of
the American volunteers at last became restive and asked
themselves, "Why should we serve England and be
treated like dogs?"</p>

<p>I often felt it necessary to speak to the men, for I
knew that their loyalty was strained almost to breaking-point.
At such moments I told them that the honour
of Jewry rested on their shoulders, and no matter what
provocation they might be subjected to, they must at
all times remain steadfast. The Imperial Government
in England was sound and sympathetic to their ideals,
and eventually justice must prevail, and the evil days
through which we were passing would soon come to
an end. I appealed to them as Jews to be good soldiers,
and, to their credit, they always responded.</p>

<p>Before this persecution became acute volunteers were
called for to serve with the Army of Occupation in
Palestine. Several hundred American enthusiasts in
the battalion offered their services, but owing to the
treatment they received their enthusiasm died out, and
they requested that they should be demobilized and
repatriated. A small party of these American citizens
who were on outpost duty at Belah, some sixty miles
to the south of Bir Salem, sent in a signed memorial
requesting demobilization; otherwise they stated that
they would refuse to do duty after a certain date which
was mentioned. This document I, of course, forwarded
to Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p>I had been writing to the authorities for months, requesting
that these men should be demobilized and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sent back to the United States, and at last I heard,
unofficially, that the order for repatriation was on
its way.</p>

<p>I sent my adjutant to inform the Belah men that
their release was coming through in the course of a few
days, and to tell them to carry on meanwhile like good
soldiers.</p>

<p>More than half of the men responded, but the rest,
being young and untrained, refused to perform any
further soldierly duties after the expiry of the time limit;
they just remained quietly in their tents, for they wished
to bring matters to a head.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that the Jewish soldiers, both
Americans and British, serving with me at Bir Salem,
stood firm and carried out their duties as usual.</p>

<p>After personal investigation into the conduct of these
foolish youths at Belah I remanded them for trial by
Field General Court Martial, and forwarded the charge
sheets, with summaries of evidence, to General Z. I
had framed the charge sheets most carefully, but
apparently my drafting did not suit the General, for he
framed fresh charges of mutiny, and sent his A.D.C.
with them to me for immediate signature. I had but
a moment to scan the charge sheets, for the A.D.C.
was impatient to catch a train which was due to leave.
I did not like the General's drafting, but, being a very
obedient soldier, I duly signed the documents as ordered
and handed them back to the waiting Staff officer,
wishing him luck with them as he galloped off.</p>

<p>According to King's Regulations, a soldier remanded
for trial by Court Martial has the right to request the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
help of an officer to act as his friend at the trial, and, of
course, it is the bounden duty of such officer to do everything
in his power to get the accused acquitted. The
Belah men petitioned Lieutenant Jabotinsky to act as
their advocate, and he, somewhat unwillingly, assented
to undertake the ungrateful task. He was not anxious
to defend these men of Belah because he held that they
should have carried out their duties faithfully to the end,
even although they felt that they had a grievance against
authority.</p>

<p>The trial took place at Kantara, and, in the course of
it, Lieutenant Jabotinsky pointed out a fatal flaw in the
charge sheets, with the result that the charge of mutiny
failed, and the Court had to be dissolved. The President
(who belonged to Major-General Louis Jean Bols' late
Regiment) was furious at the fiasco, and said, "This is
all the fault of Colonel Patterson, and I shall report
him." My adjutant, Captain Sandison, a staunch
and sturdy Scot, was present in Court as Prosecutor,
and, knowing all the facts of the case, at once turned
on the President and said, "You have no right,
Sir, to make such a statement about my Commanding
Officer. The G.O.C. Division rejected his charge
sheets, which were in perfect order, and framed
the faulty ones himself, so now you know whom to
report."</p>

<p>A new Court had to be convened, but the men were
now arraigned merely on the lesser charge of disobeying
an order. Even on this lesser charge they were
savagely sentenced to various terms of penal servitude,
ranging from seven years downwards. Had they been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
found guilty by the first Court on the charge of mutiny
I presume they would all have been shot!</p>

<p>I am confident that if these young Americans had
been properly trained as soldiers, this Belah incident
would never have taken place. I had given the
authorities ample warning of what was likely to happen
when these recruits were thrust upon me, but my advice
was ignored.</p>

<p>All I can say is that if an Australian, English, Irish,
or a Scottish battalion had been treated as this Jewish
battalion was treated, Divisional Headquarters would
have gone up in flames and the General himself would
have been lucky to escape.</p>

<p>Be it noted that the mutineers of other British units,
the men who had openly defied all authority and set
Kantara in a blaze, were not even put on trial!</p>

<p>Until the recruits were forcibly thrust upon me, I can
vouch for it that the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers was
one of the most exemplary units that ever took the field,
crime being practically unknown. The men endured
hard marching, hard knocks, fatiguing manual labour,
at times scanty rations of food and water, the seething
heat of the Jordan Valley and the anti-Semitism of the
local military authorities, and withal gained the highest
praise from the General Officer Commanding under
whom they served in the field.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that we were so despitefully
used, the authorities found that the men's services were
invaluable. In addition to garrisoning large areas of
Palestine, I had officers, N.C.O.s, and men, holding
all kinds of important posts throughout the E.E.F.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
from Aleppo to Cairo. The demand for men from the
38th Battalion was ever on the increase, for executive
officers found the Jewish soldier steady, sober and
reliable, three qualities, the importance of which I was
always impressing on the men, although, as a matter of
fact, sobriety is one of the outstanding virtues of the
Jewish soldier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Fall of Goliath.</span></div>


<p>The violent anti-Semitism shown by General Z at
last reached such a pitch that on one occasion (the
16th July to be exact), he rode into camp and, without
the slightest provocation, abused and insulted the men,
threatened one of them, and actually went so far as to
strike an unoffending private soldier with his whip, using
at the same time language which would make Billingsgate
blush.</p>

<p>I was not present at this outrage, but I heard a full
account of all that happened from various eye-witnesses
who reported the affair, and all I could imagine was that
the General must have suddenly gone insane.</p>

<p>The whole battalion was in an uproar, and I had much
ado to pacify the men and keep things going.</p>

<p>The man who was struck was sent to Hospital with
a swollen arm, and the other men who were specifically
insulted reported to me at the orderly room and complained
of the treatment they had received. I forwarded
their complaint to General Z, together with the
sick report of the man he had struck with his whip. He
replied requesting me to have these particular men
paraded so that he might speak to them.</p>

<p>I arranged for this embarrassing interview, and, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
prevent any hostility which the outraged battalion might
have shown towards General Z when he entered the
camp, I kept the men in their tents, with N.C.O.s in
charge of each door, with instructions to see that no untoward
incident took place.</p>

<p>On arrival the General apologised to the insulted men,
but so indignant were they that at first they refused to
accept it, or to shake hands when he offered to do so.
Finally, after over half-an-hour's persuasion, they
agreed to accept his apology, provided it was given publicity,
and also to the whole battalion on parade. This
he did very fully, and I sincerely hoped that the incident
was happily ended, and that for the future, in dealing
with us, General Z would see that no injustice was done
merely because we were Jews.</p>

<p>To compensate for all the misfortunes we were called
upon to endure, our life in the battalion itself was quite
smooth and happy, all pulling well together.</p>

<p>Personally, I took no thought whether a man was a
Jew or a Gentile; I remember that an officer joined us
while we were serving at the front, and, through some
misunderstanding, I took him to be a Jewish officer.
He distinguished himself later and earned the M.C.,
which pleased me very much, for I was always glad
when I was able to recommend a Jewish officer for promotion
or reward. I sent this officer with nine others to
form a "Minyan" (the number required to hold a
Jewish religious service) at the burial of a Jewish soldier
who was killed on the day we captured the Umm esh
Shert Ford, and it was not until after this incident happened
that I discovered he was a Gentile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one exception, however, to the general
harmony and <i>esprit de corps</i> of the battalion. A Staff
officer was sent to do duty with us from G.H.Q., where
he had been employed for over a year. Some time after
his arrival he publicly insulted one of my Jewish officers
and refused to apologise. The matter was then brought
before me, and, as he still remained obdurate, I brought
him before General Z. When asked by the latter why
he had insulted the Jewish officer his reply was, "I
don't like Jews. <i>The Jews are not liked at G.H.Q.,
and you know it, Sir."</i> The General ordered him to
apologise, which I must say he did most handsomely,
but his remarks about the dislike of Jews at G.H.Q.,
though no news to me or the General, may be somewhat
illuminating to the reader!</p>

<p>Although we hoped that all unpleasantness with the
General was over, I regret to say that this was not the
case. I could give many instances of unfair treatment
to which we were subjected, but I will not weary the
reader by relating them here. After his apology the
General never again came near us, and every indignity,
slight and petty tyranny that could be invented was put
upon the battalion. The whole subsequent attitude of the
G.O.C. showed us that his apology was merely eye-wash,
and had simply been extracted from him by fear
of the consequences of his outrageous behaviour.</p>

<p>In fact, in the end, I had to bring his conduct to the
notice of the Commander-in-Chief, with the result that
he was removed from his Command and no longer
troubled Israel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Protests.</span></div>


<p>In case any readers may think that my account is
exaggerated I give some letters of protest which
I received from some of the officers in my battalion.
From this it will be seen what a difficult position I was
placed in, owing to the policy of G.H.Q. towards Jewish
aspirations.</p>

<p>A few interested parties, for their own ends, sedulously
spread the rumour that there was no anti-Semitism
shown in Palestine. I will leave the reader to judge
whether these people were knaves or fools:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">Ludd</span>,<br />
4-7-19,<br />
A7/48.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I beg to report that the men are discontented,
not only in our battalion, but also in the other
Jewish units, which cannot fail to influence our men
still more.</p>

<p>The causes of their discontent are much deeper
than delay of Demobilization. Over 3/7ths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Judæans in this country are men who volunteered
to serve in Palestine in the name of their Zionist
ideals, and in reply to the pledge embodied in
the declaration which Mr. Balfour, on behalf of
H.M. Government, issued on the 2nd November,
1917.</p>

<p>It is now a general impression among our
soldiers, an impression shared by the public opinion
of Palestine, that this pledge has been broken, so
far as local authorities are concerned.</p>

<p>Palestine has become the theatre of an undisguised
anti-Semitic policy. Elementary equality
of rights is denied the Jewish inhabitants; the Holy
City, where the Jews are by far the largest community,
has been handed over to a militantly anti-Semitic
municipality; violence against Jews is
tolerated, and whole districts are closed to them by
threats of such violence under the very eyes of the
authorities; high officials, guilty of acts which any
Court would qualify as instigation to anti-Jewish
pogroms, not only go unpunished, but retain their
official positions. The Hebrew language is officially
disregarded and humiliated; anti-Semitism and
anti-Zionism is the fashionable attitude among
officials who take their cue from superior authority;
and honest attempts to come to an agreement with
Arabs are being frustrated by such means as penalising
those Arab notables who betray pro-Jewish
feeling.</p>

<p>The Jewish soldier is treated as an outcast. The
hard and honest work of our battalions is recompensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by scorn and slander, which, starting from
centres of high authority, have now reached the
rank and file, and envenomed the relations between
Jewish and English soldiers. When there is a
danger of anti-Jewish excesses, Jewish soldiers are
removed from the threatened areas and employed
on fatigues, and not even granted the right to
defend their own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Passover was selected to insult their deepest
religious feelings, by barring them access to the
Wailing Wall during that week. No Jewish detachment
is allowed to be stationed in Jerusalem or
any of the other Holy Cities of Jewry.</p>

<p>When a Jewish sentry is attacked and beaten by
a dozen drunken soldiers, and a drunken officer
disarms with ignominy a Jewish guard, nobody is
punished. Leave to certain towns has become a
torture because the Military Police have been
specially instructed to hunt the Jew, and the
weaker ones among our men escape this humiliation
by concealing their regimental badge, and substituting
the badge of some other unit.</p>

<p>In addition, army pledges given to them are also
disregarded; men who were recruited for service
in Palestine are sent against their will to Messina
or Egypt or Cyprus; men who enlisted under the
understanding that their pay would be equal to
that of any British soldier suddenly discover that
no allowances will be paid to their wives and
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Under these conditions, even some of the best
among them give way to despair; they see no purpose
in carrying on, conscious that the great pledge
has been broken, that instead of a National Home
for the Jewish people, Palestine has become the
field of operations of official anti-Semitism; they
abhor the idea of covering with their tacit connivance
what they&mdash;and not they alone&mdash;consider a
fraud.</p>

<p>They cannot formulate these grievances in full,
nor gather the documents necessary to prove them,
but under their desire to "get out of the show"
there is bitter disappointment, one of the most
cruel even in Jewish history.</p>

<p>You, Sir, have always been in favour of speeding
up their demobilization; I, as you know, was of
the opinion that it is the duty of every volunteer to
stick to the Jewish Regiment as long as circumstances
might demand, and I still hope that many
will stick to it in spite of all. But even I myself
am compelled to admit that things have reached
a stage when no further moral sacrifice can
fairly be demanded of men whose faith has been
shattered.</p>

<p>I only hope that those who give up the struggle
will not follow the example of a few misguided irresponsibles
who chose the wrong way to support a
right claim. I hope that they will await their
release in a calm and dignified manner, discharging
their duties to the last moment, and thus giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
those who misrule this country a lesson in fair play&mdash;a
lesson badly needed.</p>

praying that I may be permitted to resign my Commission
in His Majesty's Forces be forwarded
through the usual channels, together with the
undermentioned reasons for my taking this step
after having originally volunteered for the Army of
Occupation.</p>

<p>My resignation, Sir, is my only method of protest
against the grossly unfair and all too prevalent
discrimination against the battalion to which I have
the honour to belong. I desire to point out to
you, Sir, the fact that this unfair and un-British
attitude affects not only my honour as a Jew, but
my prestige as a British officer, and this latter point
must inevitably handicap me in the efficient discharge
of my military duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The disgraceful exhibition of yesterday morning
is but a fitting climax to the endless series of insults
and annoyances to which this battalion&mdash;because it
is a <i>Jewish Battalion</i>&mdash;has been subjected, almost
since our first arrival in the E.E.F. Insults to a
battalion as a whole, Sir, are insults directed to
every individual member of that battalion, and as
long as I remain a member of His Majesty's
Forces, I regret to say I find myself unable to
fittingly resent in a manner compatible with my own
honour, and the honour of my race, the insulting
attitude towards my race, and through my race, towards
me, of my military superiors.</p>

<p>In passing, may I point out that my being a Jew
did not prevent me doing my duty in France, in
Flanders, and in Palestine, and in the name of the
countless dead of my race who fell doing their duty
in every theatre of war, I resent, and resent very
strongly indeed, the abusive attitude at present
prevalent towards Jewish troops.</p>

<p>I have innumerable instances of petty spite, and
not a few cases of a very serious character indeed,
all of which I can readily produce should the
occasion ever arise.</p>

<p>It was not only my Jewish officers who found life unbearable
under these conditions, but the other officers
also felt the strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>I received the following letter from one of my senior

years of age, and have had nothing except my desire
to do my duty to keep me in the Service. The
impossible conditions forced on the battalion by
higher authority are too much for me, and I very
much regret that I should have to trouble you with

</blockquote>

<p>Letters such as these give some slight conception of
the extremely difficult position in which I was placed.
On the one hand I had to ward off the blows aimed at the
battalion by the local military authorities, while on the
other hand I had to do my utmost to allay the angry feelings
of my officers, N.C.O.s, and men, goaded almost to
desperation by the attitude adopted towards the battalion.</p>

<p>This anti-Jewish policy was directed not only against
the Jewish Battalions, but also, in a flagrant manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
against the Jewish civil population, upon whom every
indignity was poured; in fact, the British Military Administration
made of the famous Balfour Declaration&mdash;the
declared policy of the British Government&mdash;a byword
and a laughing stock.</p>

<p>Early in 1919 the Chief Administrator then in office
in Palestine, the man who represented the British
Government, offered a public insult to the Jews at a
Jewish Concert, by deliberately sitting down and
ordering his staff to do the same when the Hatikvah,
the Jewish national hymn, was being sung, while, of
course, all others were standing. This was as deliberate
an insult as could be offered to the feelings of any people.
England must be in a bad way when a man such as this
is appointed to represent her as Governor.</p>

<p>Judge Brandies, of the United States Supreme Court,
visited Palestine about the time when these anti-Jewish
manifestations were at their height, and was shocked
and horrified at the un-English attitude he saw adopted
towards the Jews and all things Jewish.</p>

<p>I myself told him of the mockery of the Balfour
Declaration as exemplified by the British Military Administration
in Palestine, and said I thought it was a pity
that Mr. Balfour had not added three more words to
his famous utterance. The Judge asked me what words
I meant, and I said they were that Palestine was to be a
national home for "the baiting of" the Jewish people!</p>

<p>I know that Judge Brandies went home hurriedly,
very much perturbed at what he heard and saw, which
was so contrary in everything to the spirit of the declared
policy of England. He represented the state of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in Palestine to Downing Street, with the result that the
local military authorities were told that the policy as laid
down in the Balfour Declaration must be carried out.</p>

<p>This was a sad blow to those purblind ones who had
looked forward to a long rule in the Middle East; for
them the writing was already on the wall.</p>

<p>I want it to be clearly understood that this attitude was
merely the policy of the local military officials who, by
their attitude, were practically defying and deriding the
policy of England, as expressed by the Home Government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">A Trip to the Sea of Galilee.</span></div>


<p>I had long looked forward to a visit to the Sea of
Galilee (Lake Tiberias), and eventually, late in
October, my ambition was fulfilled, for, taking advantage
of "Damascus week," when leave was easy to
get, I slipped off from Ludd one morning at 8.30, and
arrived at Samakh, on the southern shores of the sea,
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>My first peep of the Lake, as it stretched out before
me and melted away in the purple haze to the north, was
delightful. The colouring was superb and, as I sat on
the edge of the rickety pier, I drank in my novel surroundings
with all the enthusiasms of a rapturous
pilgrim.</p>

<p>The Lake glistened and glinted in the brilliant sunshine,
the abrupt arid-looking hill-sides deepened the
silent mystery that seemed to hang over it. Away to
the right was the spot where the Gadarene swine, possessed
of the evil spirit, rushed down to the sea and
destroyed themselves.</p>

<p>Peering through my glasses straight north, I could
see in the shimmering distance the dense groves of evergreens
which told me that this was the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Jordan plunged down from "the waters of Merom"
through a rocky gorge, and entered the Lake. Away
to the left I caught a glimpse of a few trees and houses,
and I realized that I was looking at Capernaum, the
place in which it will be remembered the worthy Roman
Centurion built a synagogue. Glancing further west,
and somewhat nearer to me, I saw the site of Bethsaida;
sweeping further westward and yet nearer, the round
towers and rectangular walls of Tiberias itself stood
revealed, while close to my left hand, at the south-west
corner of the Lake, the thriving Jewish colony of
Kinnereth overlooked the spot where the Jordan rushed
out of the Lake on its way to the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>Round about me were children revelling in the limpid
water, and even a few discreetly-veiled damsels displayed
a fair share of their neat limbs, while paddling along the
sandy shore in the shade of the cliffs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, into all this old-world scenery, there dashed
a lively motor-boat, which had come from Tiberias to
collect passengers. We scrambled down from the crazy
pier, and within an hour found ourselves climbing up
the rickety gangway leading to Tiberias, a city which
stands to-day much as King Herod Antipas, the
builder, left it, although, in the meantime, it has been
much devastated by earthquakes.</p>

<p>I was agreeably surprised to find a clean and fairly
comfortable hotel, most capably managed by Frau
Grossmann. It was still hot at Tiberias, and yet, by
some mysterious means, Frau Grossmann always
managed to produce a bottle of cold beer for dinner, a
most grateful drink in this thirsty valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early morning, I hired a boat with a good-humoured
Arab crew of three, and made an expedition
across to Capernaum. Fish are still as plentiful here
as they were in the days of Simon Peter, and the
Capernaum fishermen still cast their nets as they did in
apostolic times, and wear just as little clothing.</p>

<p>As I wandered among the ruins, I met a striking
Franciscan, Father Vendelene, who was hospitality
itself. He was a venerable German, a very fine-looking
man, standing over six feet high, full of Christian charity,
and apparently resigned to the blow which had fallen
upon his nation. Besides being a monk he was also an
architect and had built many monasteries, convents, and
churches for the Franciscans in many parts of the world;
but he had been a soldier before he became a monk,
and I noticed, as he smoked a pipe and related to me
his varied career, that his eyes glowed, and his broad
shoulders were thrown back, as he described how he
charged at the head of his squadron of Hussars in one
of the battles of the Franco-Prussian War. The good
Father took me round what was left of the synagogue
built by the worthy Centurion whose servant was
healed. It must have been a fine piece of architecture
in its day, and it is a thousand pities that it has been
levelled to the ground by an earthquake.</p>

<p>On my return to the hotel I found that two Nursing
Sisters had arrived from Egypt to spend a few days at
Tiberias, and at dinner I suggested that they should join
me in my boat on a voyage of discovery which I intended
to make across the Lake on the following morning, and
to this they readily agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The Military Governor of Tiberias had very kindly
arranged for a mounted escort and a horse to be ready
for me at the north end of the Lake where the Jordan
enters it, as I wished to make an exploring expedition as
far as possible up the river towards Lake Merom.</p>

<p>We left Tiberias at dawn and had a most delightful
trip across the Lake, breakfasting in the boat on the way.
Sister Cook, who was blessed with a charming voice,
was moved to song, and the time passed so pleasantly
that before we knew where we were, we found ourselves
stuck on a sandbar in the Jordan River itself.
Our boatmen hopped out, pushed the boat over the bar
into deep water, and off we paddled again up the famous
river. Great fields of ripe maize stretched away on
either hand, and it was curious to see dusky youths
perched aloft on stagings, armed with a sling, doing
slaughter among any birds that dared to settle on their
crops. We shoved the nose of our boat into the bank,
took a stroll along a path through the tangled undergrowth,
and soon met a crowd of Bedouins who presented
us with some delicious maize cobs. In this
manner we pleasantly meandered up the Jordan, now
landing on this bank, and now on that, as it took our
fancy, until at last a point was reached where the river
was so shallow that the boat could go no further, and
here I found my pony and escort awaiting me.</p>

<p>The latter was composed of local mounted Arab gendarmerie,
under the command of a Jewish corporal, who
had at one time served in the 40th Battalion Royal
Fusiliers, and I noticed with pleasure that the Jew and
the Arabs seemed to be on excellent terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>I charged the boatman to take the Sisters to Capernaum,
where I told them to call on Father Vendelene,
who I knew would give them a warm welcome.</p>

<p>Having seen the boat safely started on the way, and
with strict injunctions to the sailors to return for me in
good time, I mounted my pony and started my exploration
of the Upper Jordan.</p>

<p>My escort (who were also supposed to be guides)
often got completely lost in the dense oleander jungle
that here abounds, but after many trials and tribulations,
in the course of which I came upon a submerged herd
of buffalo sleeping peacefully in a marshy backwater, I
emerged torn and bleeding at the entrance of the black
rocky gorge down which the Jordan rushes. Riding
here became impossible, so I went on foot until the
westering sun warned me it was time to return.</p>

<p>On the way back, which was by another and much
easier route, we came across a stalwart Bedouin hunter
who, only five days before, had shot a splendid leopard
on the hillside.</p>

<p>I asked him if there was any chance of my being able
to do likewise. He replied that it was possible, but I
might have to wait a month before I got a shot; I could,
however, have other good hunting any day I liked, for
the thickets were alive with wild boar. This man knew
every track round about, and, as we were still shut in
by dense thickets, he volunteered to come with me as
a guide to the Lake. On parting he refused all offers
of money, but later I sent him some tobacco, which I
hope he received safely. My escort, when we reached
open level country, raced and chased each other on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
ponies, pulling up suddenly, or darting to the right or
left in wild career. Both rode thoroughbred Arab mares
and were immensely proud of their steeds, and their own
prowess thereon.</p>

<p>On reaching the Lake, I espied the boat coming
along, and as the water was shallow I urged my mount
into it and rode out to meet the little vessel. The Arab
boatmen, singing some quaint chorus, came alongside
and I slipped off the saddle on to the gunwale, waved
good-bye to my friends of the gendarmerie, and headed
the boat for Capernaum to pick up the Sisters. Here
I found that they had had a great time. Just as they
were in the midst of a mild flirtation with Father Vendelene,
who was showing them round his demesne, who
should walk in but the Papal Legate, Cardinal Filippo
Giustini, just arrived from Rome on a tour of inspection!
The good cardinal was not horrified, however, for he
insisted on the ladies coming into the Refectory, where
he himself poured them out a cup of tea.</p>

<p>On the way back from Capernaum we hugged the
west coast of the Lake and made a call at Migdal, an
up-to-date Jewish fruit farm on the site of the ancient
Magdala, the birthplace of that romantic figure in the
New Testament, Mary Magdalene. Unfortunately,
the manager, Mr. Glickin, was away, but his representative
gave us a delightful tea in the open, under the
shade of an enormous fig tree. Here fruits and flowers
of all kinds were showered upon us, oranges, pomegranates,
bananas, nuts, almonds, etc., all of the most
delicious flavour. Our boatmen had much ado in carrying
all our gifts down to the shore.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />RUINS OF THE OLD CITY OF TIBERIAS<br />
(<i>See page <a href="#Page_245">245</a></i>)</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>We then skirted the Lake, and when nearing Tiberias
saw the caves where the famous Jewish philosopher
Maimonides, and the two famous Rabbis, Meir and Ben
Akiba, are buried.</p>

<p>Not very far from Tiberias is the pit of Joseph, which
old Arabian geographers maintain is the identical one
into which the favourite son of Jacob was cast.</p>

<p>Darkness was now swiftly coming on and, as we
neared Tiberias, in the twinkling of an eye, a sudden
squall burst upon us, and we were glad to reach the
little haven in safety.</p>

<p>Altogether it had been a very full day and the Sisters
assured me that they would look upon it as one of the
red-letter days of their lives.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Sea of Galilee, I made an excursion
to the wonderful hot sulphur baths, about three
miles to the south of Tiberias, and saw the boiling water
gushing out of the cleft in a rock. There is a bathhouse
close by where people afflicted with rheumatism
dip in these medicinal waters and are made whole again.</p>

<p>On the way back from these springs I passed through
the ruins of the old city of Tiberias, with its columns all
awry and prostrate, and mounds of débris covering a
considerable extent. On a hill, just above the modern
Tiberias, stand the ruins of Herod's Palace, and I there
saw what is reputed to be the chamber where Herodias'
daughter danced for the head of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>In enterprising hands, Tiberias could be made to
flourish exceedingly as a winter resort. There one can
have excellent boating, fishing, boar-hunting, explorations
on horseback through the exceedingly interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
country which surrounds it, and at the same time cure all
one's ills in the wonderful hot baths.</p>

<p>Beautiful Palestinian lace is made in this old Hebrew
city by industrious Jewish girls, and I brought away
some very fine examples of their work.</p>

<p>There is an old synagogue near the Hot Springs
where the celebrated Rabbi Meir expounded the law
to Israel.</p>

<p>Before I left Galilee I met my old friend, Captain
Trumpeldor, who had served under me in the Zion Mule
Corps in Gallipoli. I was delighted to see this gallant
officer once more, and we had a long chat over old times.
Trumpeldor had only just returned from Russia, where
he had been organizing a Jewish Legion for service in
Palestine. The Bolsheviks, however, interfered with
his plans, and he was lucky to escape from their clutches.
Sad to relate, a few months after our meeting in Galilee,
Captain Trumpeldor met his death there, while defending
a Jewish Colony from a raiding party of Bedouins.
He directed the defence for two hours after he had been
mortally wounded, and then died, fighting to the last.
He was one of the most gallant men I have ever met,
and his loss is keenly felt by all his friends and comrades.</p>

<p>The Sea of Galilee is bound to have an enormous
influence on the economic life of Palestine. Here we
have stored up practically an unlimited supply of latent
energy. This great mass of water is situated some 700
feet above the level of the Dead Sea, into which its
overflow, the Jordan runs.</p>

<p>A canal constructed from the south-west corner of
Lake Tiberias, and graded along the Jordan Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
would, in the length of a few miles, give a vertical fall
of over 300 feet. A suitable hydro-electric plant
erected at the site of the falls would produce enough
energy to revolutionise every phase of life in the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that so far neither coal nor
oil have been found in the country, while forests do not
exist; consequently the cost of all kinds of fuel is very
high, and industrial undertakings, where cheap power
is a factor, are out of the question.</p>

<p>What a Heaven-sent boon then is this stored-up
energy of the blessed Jordan. Cheap light, heat, and
power can be had from it throughout the length and
breadth of Palestine. Touch a switch in summer and a
whirling fan will keep one's house delightfully cool, while
in the winter electrical fires will provide warmth in the
chilly evenings on the hill-tops. Evil smelling paraffin
lamps and stoves will be a thing of the past, for, of
course, electricity will provide all that is necessary in
the way of fuel and light.</p>

<p>Ample power is available for the electrification of the
existing railways, and, of course, light tramways could
be operated all over the country.</p>

<p>Great areas of land now lying fallow could be irrigated
and made fruitful and capable of sustaining a large
population.</p>

<p>If Palestine is to become a home for any large number
of the Jewish people, this great source of economic life
must be turned to account, and all the land blessed by the
amazing benefits which electricity can shower upon it.</p>

<p>Jewish brains, Jewish capital, and Jewish workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
will undoubtedly carry out this scheme, and gradually
the country, which is now arid and neglected, will be
turned once more into a land flowing with milk and
honey. The hills will again be terraced and crowned
with fig and olive trees, and the valleys and plains will
abound with ripening corn.</p>

<p>The country which for hundreds of years has been at
a standstill, lends itself to all kinds of industrial enterprises,
such as fruit-farming, olive oil and soap factories,
fishing and canning, etc.</p>

<p>The trade and commerce that will flow through Palestine
is not to be measured by the paltry revenue returns
now shown. When the country is developed, the old
trade routes with the hinterland reopened, and the ports
at Haifa and Jaffa improved, its importance, commercially,
will be enhanced beyond all recognition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Strange Methods of the E.E.F. Staff.</span></div>


<p>It will be remembered that Lieutenant Jabotinsky
was responsible for the idea of forming a Jewish
Legion to help England in her great struggle for world
freedom.</p>

<p>The British Government was impressed with the
possibilities he placed before it, and eventually he was
summoned to the War Office by Lord Derby, then
Secretary of State for War, and to the War Cabinet by
General Smuts, to expound his proposals. These high
officials did not disdain to meet and confer with Jabotinsky
on the Jewish Legion question, although at that
time he was merely a private soldier, serving in the 20th
Battalion of the London Regiment. They knew that
he held a very high place in the Zionist movement, and
was looked up to by the Jewish masses the world over
as one of its most brilliant young leaders.</p>

<p>This fact was also known to the Staff of the E.E.F.,
but when, as an officer, in August, 1919, Lieutenant
Jabotinsky sought an interview with the Commander-in-Chief,
hoping that he might induce the local authorities
to change their anti-Jewish policy in Palestine, he
was not only refused a hearing, but methods were immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
employed to strike him down which I can
only describe as despicable and un-English.</p>

<p>Jabotinsky was, of course, pro-British to the core.
During his service in Palestine he had been for a time
specially attached to the Zionist Commission with the
sanction of the Commander-in-Chief. While he was
employed in this capacity he brought about the acceptance
of a programme by the Jewish Colonists, expressly
calling for a British Mandate for Palestine.</p>

<p>All through his military service with the Battalion
he, to my personal knowledge, did his utmost to allay
the feelings of resentment felt by the Jewish soldiers
at the bad treatment they received at the hands of the
military authorities, treatment utterly undeserved and
uncalled for, but apparently deliberately adopted to
further what appeared to be the local policy of making
the practical application of the Balfour Declaration an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Hostility to all things Jewish was so open, that only
those who wilfully shut their eyes could fail to see the
game that was being played by certain interested parties.
Jabotinsky saw that the line of action adopted must inevitably
lead to outbreaks against the Jews, and
naturally wanted to ward off such a calamity.</p>

<p>Do not let the reader imagine that there was bad blood
between the Palestinian Arabs and the Zionists. That
both had dwelt together in unity and concord for over
forty years is proof to the contrary.</p>

<p>The anti-Jewish outbreak, which actually took place
later on, was carefully fostered, and the hooligan element
amongst the Arabs openly encouraged to acts of violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
by certain individuals who, for their own ends, hoped
to shatter the age-long aspirations of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that it was assumed in some
quarters that when trouble, which had been deliberately
encouraged, arose, the Home Government, embarrassed
by a thousand difficulties at its doors, would agree
with the wire-pullers in Palestine, and say to the Jewish
people that the carrying out of the Balfour Declaration,
owing to the hostility displayed by the Arabs, was outside
the range of practical politics.</p>

<p>To these schemers it must have been somewhat
galling, to say the least of it, to find certain men openly
fighting them, foot by foot, and inch by inch, for the
realisation of the ideals expressed in the famous
Declaration.</p>

<p>One of these men was Jabotinsky, a man with a
notable name in Jewry, therefore a thrust at him would
also be a blow to Jewish prestige in Palestine. He was
a mere foreigner, a Jew from Russia, and presumably
without influential friends&mdash;a man, surely, on whom
officialdom could safely pour out the vials of its unjust
wrath, without any fear of evil consequences to itself.</p>

<p>At all events, contemptible methods were adopted in
order to strike at the man who had dared to let the
authorities know that their local policy was a menace to
his people dwelling in the Holy Land, and a serious
danger to the Restoration.</p>

<p>When Jabotinsky saw that certain members of the
Staff were adopting measures towards Jewish soldiers,
and Jewish ideals in Palestine, which must inevitably
result in disaster, and being loth to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Commander-in-Chief could be privy to such a policy, he
addressed the following letter to General Allenby.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I was the initiator of both the Zion Mule Corps
and the actual Jewish Battalions. To-day I am
forced to witness how my work is breaking into
pieces under the intolerable burden of disappointment,
despair, broken pledges, and anti-Semitism,
permeating the whole administrative and military
atmosphere, the hopelessness of all effort and of all
devotion.</p>

<p>The common opinion is that you are an enemy
of Zionism in general, and of the Jewish Legion in
particular. I still try to believe that this is not
true, that things happen without your knowledge,
that there is a misunderstanding, and that the
situation can yet improve.</p>

<p>In this hope, as the last attempt to stop a process
which threatens to impair for ever Anglo-Jewish
friendship throughout the world, I beg you to grant
me a personal interview and permission to speak
freely. This letter is entrusted to your chivalry.</p>

<div class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">V. Jabotinsky.</span></div>
</blockquote>

<p>I knew nothing whatever about the despatch of this
letter, and although I am aware that red tape will hold
up its hands in holy horror at the audacity of it, it must
be remembered that Jabotinsky's position was an exceptional
one. He was not a British subject, and not
used to the routine of British red tape. Members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
British Imperial War Cabinet thought it good policy to
hear his views, and, no doubt, when he entrusted this
letter to the chivalry of General Allenby, he felt confident
that if he was making any deviation from ordinary
routine, it was for a good purpose and would not be
counted against him.</p>

<p>It is an open, straightforward, honest letter, a heartfelt
cry from a man who sees that the whole structure
which he has been at such pains to build is in serious
peril of being overthrown by the machinations of the
anti-Jewish people on the Staff.</p>

<p>And now a curious thing happened. It was known
to the Staff that Jabotinsky was at the time staying in
Jaffa, and that he was to be found almost daily at the
house of a friend who was living there. About a week
after he had sent his letter to the Commander-in-Chief,
a Staff-Major from G.H.Q., E.E.F., appeared in
Jaffa and took up his quarters in the same house as
that in which Jabotinsky's friend dwelt. When the
inevitable meeting took place, the Staff-Major, who, by
the way, knew Jabotinsky well, remarked that the
Commander-in-Chief had received his (Jabotinsky's)
letter, and would probably send for him one of these
days, but that, in the meantime, it would be well if
Jabotinsky stated his grievances then and there to himself.
"You can speak to me openly as to a friend,"
said the Major. "I have some influence at G.H.Q.,
and I shall be glad to assist in righting any wrong done
to Jews."</p>

<p>On hearing this, Jabotinsky unhesitatingly explained
the situation, both as to its effects on the Regiment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
on Jewish aspirations in Palestine. The result of this
"friendly conversation" was a mendacious report
written by the Staff-Major to the Deputy Adjutant-General
at G.H.Q., E.E.F.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards, by a mere chance, I saw a copy
of this report, and so far as it referred to Jabotinsky, it
was practically untrue from beginning to end.</p>

<p>If the responsible authorities at G.H.Q. knew of the
method adopted to lure Jabotinsky into the "friendly
conversation" which served as a pretext for a gross libel
on his character, it reminds one of the good old days when
Governments had recourse to "Agents provocateurs."
What G.H.Q. certainly should have known was that the
accusations levelled at Jabotinsky by a member of their
Staff were absolutely untrue. They knew him to be a
good and gallant officer who had done his duty, and much
more than his duty, faithfully and well to England, but
it would appear as if they were greedy for such a document
and swallowed it with avidity without any reference
to me or, so far as I know, to anybody else.</p>

<p>I think that even the most prejudiced of my readers
will admit that in fairness and justice to Jabotinsky this
secret report should have been submitted to him for
his information, and such explanation and refutation
as he could give, before any action was taken against
him.</p>

<p>It is strictly laid down in the King's Regulations that
all adverse reports must be shown to the officer whose
reputation is affected, but, as I have shown over and over
again, the Staff of the E.E.F. were apparently a law
unto themselves and above even King's Regulations!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew nothing whatever of all that had been going
on; I knew nothing of Jabotinsky's letter to the Commander-in-Chief;
I knew nothing of his interview
with the Staff-Major from G.H.Q., and, needless to
say, I knew nothing of the report which the latter had
written.</p>

<p>My first inkling of the situation was through an official
letter emanating from the Deputy Adjutant-General,
which stated that "the Commander-in-Chief has his
own duly constituted advisers on matters of policy and
is not prepared to grant an interview to a Lieutenant of
the 38th Battalion Royal Fusiliers to discuss such
matters."</p>

<p>From this moment G.H.Q. lost no time in getting
rid of Jabotinsky. On the 29th August, 1919, I received
an urgent order to send this officer to Kantara
for immediate demobilization. This took me by surprise,
for I was very short of Jewish Officers, and stood
much in need of Jabotinsky's services in the Battalion.</p>

<p>I wrote and protested against his demobilization,
stating that I needed his services, but the only result was
the receipt of the following peremptory memorandum:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A direct order was conveyed for Lieutenant
Jabotinsky to proceed to Demobilization Camp,
Kantara, forthwith. If he has not already gone,
this officer will leave for Kantara by rail to-day.
Non-compliance with this order will lead to disciplinary
action being taken. Please report
departure."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above was signed by a Staff Officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>As a result of this piece of Prussianism, Jabotinsky
had to proceed to Kantara, where at lightning speed he
was demobilised.</p>

<p>He wrote a protest to the Army Council, which I
forwarded with my own views on the case. The appeal
was a lengthy one, but I will merely quote the following
passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With the deepest reluctance and regret I must
say that I consider this action shows ingratitude. I
do not deserve it at the hands of the British
Authorities. From the first days of this War I
have worked and struggled for British interests. I
am neither a British subject nor an immigrant.
I had never been in the United Kingdom or in any
British Dominion before this War. I came to
England in 1915 as a Russian Journalist, correspondent
of the oldest Liberal paper in Russia, the
Moscow <i>Wiedomosti</i>. As a correspondent I did my
best to explain to the Russian public the British
effort and to combat the anti-British propaganda.
At the same time I started on my own initiative a
pro-Entente and pro-British propaganda amongst
neutral and Russian Jewry. At that time many
Jews bitterly resented England's alliance with
Russia. In the autumn, 1915, I founded a Yiddish
fortnightly (<i>Di Tribune</i>) in Copenhagen,
which took up a strong anti-German and anti-Turkish
attitude. Its articles were constantly
quoted in the American Jewish Press, and found
their way even into Germany and Austria. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>again I have the right to say that I was one of the
few&mdash;perhaps one of the <i>two</i> men (counting Dr.
Weizmann first)&mdash;responsible for the origin of the
present pro-British attitude of all Jewry. I may
add that I did all this at my own expense, or with
means provided by my Zionist friends, without any
support from any British source.</p>

<p>Against this I know of no facts which could justify
the attitude taken up by G.H.Q., E.E.F. I have
never heard of any complaint or censure of my conduct
as Officer or Man; I have never been informed
or even given a hint that anything in my activity
could be objected to.</p>

<p>My compulsory Demobilization under these conditions
will throw a slur on my name. I consider
it unjust. I request that it be annulled, and that
I be reinstated in my well-earned position as an
Officer of the Judæans."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A reply to this appeal was never received, and I do
not know whether it ever reached the Army Council.</p>

<p>Thus came about the victimization of Jabotinsky, the
man who had done so much for England in her hour of
need; who had over and over again in the firing line
shown that he was prepared to make even the last great
sacrifice itself in the cause for which England was fighting.
As a reward for all his devotion to England he
was, by strange and un-English devices, practically
drummed out of the Army.</p>

<p>I think my readers will agree with me that the scandalous
course of action pursued by the Staff of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
E.E.F. in the case of Lieutenant Jabotinsky would, if
it became popular in high places, soon bring our country
to ruin and rob us of our fair name.</p>

<p>We know what the corrupt Bureaucrats have done for
the once mighty Russian Empire. Had fair play and
justice held sway there we would never have beheld the
present orgy of Bolshevism which is sweeping through
that unhappy country.</p>

<p>Let all kings, princes, rulers and governors remember
that to "do justice and ensue it" makes the stoutest
barrier against Bolshevism, for, as it says in Ecclesiastes,
"oppression maketh a wise man mad."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The First Judæans.</span></div>


<p>Nothing but a sense of the duty which I owed
to my officers and men induced me to continue
serving in such a hostile atmosphere after the armistice
had been declared.</p>

<p>We suffered, but we suffered in silence, and just
"carried on."</p>

<p>In the midst of our tribulations we, however, scored
a decided triumph, for the year-old decision of the War
Office was at last announced by the local Staff that we
had won a special name, viz., the Judæans, and that
H.M. the King had sanctioned the Menorah as a special
badge for the Battalion.</p>

<p>The withholding of this information from us for a full
year could not have been an oversight, for I had
repeatedly written to ask if the War Office had not
sanctioned this name and badge for the Battalion, but
received no reply. I can only presume that the object
of G.H.Q. in withholding this information, which would
have brought prestige to the Jews, was that they had
hoped to get the Battalion disbanded and abolished so
that it might never have the gratification of knowing that
the Imperial Authorities considered that the Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Battalion had distinguished itself, and was therefore
entitled to the special name and badge promised in 1917
by Lord Derby when Secretary of State for War.</p>

<p>Just after we had received this good news, I was
gladdened by receiving from the Council of Jews at
Jerusalem a beautifully illuminated parchment scroll,
thanking me for the stand I had made in upholding the
ideals expressed in the Balfour Declaration, and for
having led the Jewish Battalions successfully in the great
struggle which resulted in the "Crown of Victory."</p>

<p>Yet one more triumph was in store for the 1st
Judæans, for, in the beginning of December, 1919,
orders came from the War Office that it was to be retained
to garrison Palestine, and that the 39th and 40th
Battalions were to be amalgamated with it.</p>

<p>It was a great satisfaction to me to learn that it was
to be retained, for a time at least, as a unit of the British
Army, and that it was to be officially known as the
First Judæans Battalion.</p>

<p>I now felt that my work was done and I could chant
my "Nunc Dimittis." I had seen my child weather
the storms which had beaten so fiercely about it, and in
the end specially chosen to garrison its own Home Land.</p>

<p>A permanent force of Judæans in Palestine is an
essentially sound measure from every point of view.</p>

<p>World Jewry would, I am sure, be willing to take the
entire cost of the maintenance of this Force on its own
shoulders; the money spent on it would be well invested,
for it would be the training centre of Palestinian volunteers.
Such a training would instil a sense of responsibility,
and enable young Jewry the more readily to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
steadfastly in the simple but sublime footsteps of their
heroic forefathers.</p>

<p>As soon as I got back to England, I had an interview
with the Adjutant-General at the War Office, and requested
that the savage sentences passed on the young
Americans at Belah should be revised. Although the
Adjutant-General was most sympathetic, he could not,
at the moment, see his way to interfere, so I then wrote
to the Prime Minister to let him know that these
American soldiers had been very harshly treated and
were still imprisoned in the Citadel at Cairo. I pointed
out that it was hardly sound policy to offend a powerful
ally by inflicting such a barbarous sentence on men who
had come over the seas as volunteers to help us in the
Great War. I therefore begged him to have their case
investigated.</p>

<p>The result of this letter was that the men were speedily
released and went back to their homes in the United
States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">the Jerusalem Pogrom.</span></div>


<p>Shortly after my return to England events
occurred in Palestine which prove up to the hilt
all that I have written with regard to the anti-Jewish
attitude of certain members of the E.E.F. Staff.</p>

<p>A veritable "pogrom," such as we have hitherto only
associated with Tsarist Russia, took place in the Holy
City of Jerusalem in April, 1920, and as this was the
climax to the maladministration of the Military Authorities,
I consider that the facts of the case should be made
public.</p>

<p>To the observant onlooker it was quite evident that
the hostile policy pursued by the Administration must
inevitably lead to outbreaks against the Jews. An intelligent
people, such as the Arabs, could not be blind
to the anti-Jewish course being steered.</p>

<p>The Balfour Declaration, that divinely inspired
message to the people of Israel, was never allowed to be
officially published within the borders of Palestine; the
Hebrew language was proscribed; there was open discrimination
against the Jews; the Jewish Regiment was
at all times kept in the background and treated as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
pariah. This official attitude was interpreted by the
hooligan element and interested schemers in the only
possible way, viz., that the military authorities in Palestine
were against the Jews and Zionism, and the conviction
began to grow, in some native minds at least, that
any act calculated to deal a death blow to Zionist aspirations
would not be unwelcome to those in authority in
the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Moreover, this malign influence was sometimes
strengthened by very plain speaking. The Military
Governor of an important town was actually heard to
declare in a Y.M.C.A. Hut, in the presence of British
and French Officers, and of Arab waiters, that in case
of anti-Jewish riots in his city, he would remove the
garrison and take up his position at a window, where he
could watch, and laugh at, what went on!</p>

<p>This amazing declaration was reported to the Acting
Chief Administrator, and the Acting Chief Political
Officer, but no action was taken against the Governor.
Only one interpretation can be placed on such
leniency.</p>

<p>In March, 1920, the following extraordinary order
was issued to the troops in Palestine:&mdash;"As the
Government <i>has to pursue</i> in Palestine a policy unpopular
with the majority of the population, trouble may be
expected to arise between the Jews and the Arabs."
This wording is very significant. It was obviously calculated
to throw the blame for any trouble on the Jews,
at the same time representing the Government as an
unfortunate victim, who, under some mysterious pressure,
"<i>has to pursue</i>" a Zionist policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment I heard that a certain officer was to be
appointed to an important post in Palestine I felt it my
duty to warn the Chief Zionist leader of the evil that
would follow such an appointment, and told him that in
the interests not only of Jewry, but of England, it was
necessary that he should make a public protest against
the appointment of this official. Although I warned
Dr. Weizmann of the dangers that would follow, he was
loth to believe that a British Officer would be disloyal to
the policy laid down by his Government. The good
Doctor had not suffered with the Jewish Battalion and
did not realize the situation or the intrigues that were
in the air. So far as I am aware, no protest was made
and this official was duly appointed. I feared for the
future, not so much on account of the Jews, as on
account of the harm that would be done to the prestige
and good name of England, and the result will show
that my fears were only too well grounded.</p>

<p>Within a few months of this appointment, public anti-Zionist
demonstrations were permitted throughout the
land. These manifestations took the form of processions
through the streets with drums beating and banners
flying, the chanting of fanatical verses against the Jews
being a feature of these displays. In Jaffa inflammatory
speeches were delivered from the steps of the Military
Governor's office, in the presence of British officials,
calling for the extermination of Zionism.</p>

<p>Arab papers were allowed to write the most outrageous
articles against the Jews, while on the other
hand, if a Jewish paper dared to say the least word of
protest, it was immediately called to account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>With these significant happenings taking place before
their eyes, and feeling that they would get little or no
protection from the Military Administration, the Jews
clearly saw that it was absolutely essential for their own
safety to form a Self-Defence Corps, for purely protective
purposes. This they did, and Lieutenant Jabotinsky
was entrusted with the command. This officer,
with the full knowledge of the Administration, enrolled
a body of young men and trained them in case of
need.</p>

<p>His first act on taking command was to inform the
Authorities of the Corps' existence, its arming, and its
purpose. He even asked the Government for weapons,
reminding them that rifles and ammunition had been
issued to Jewish Colonists in Galilee under similar circumstances.
It must be remembered that the Jewish
people in Palestine never gave the Authorities a
moment's anxiety; on the contrary, they were most law-abiding
citizens, who helped the British Administration
in every conceivable way. They were astounded and
mystified by the hostility displayed towards them by the
local Military Administration, and it is not too much to
say that they went in fear of their lives, for the hooligan
element in the Arab quarter began to declare openly that
they would slaughter them.</p>

<p>The day when an outbreak on the part of the cut-throats
was expected was Friday, 2nd April, for on that
date the celebrated "Nebi Musa" procession was to
take place. Moslems from all parts of Palestine meet
once a year for prayer at the Mosque of Omar (built
on the site of Solomon's temple), and then form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
procession to the Tomb of Moses in the Jordan Valley,
near the Dead Sea. The Moslem world holds Moses
in great veneration as a Prophet, and believes that when
he died on Mount Nebo, a Bedouin carried his body
across the Jordan and buried it at the shrine now known
as Nebi Musa, which is annually visited by thousands of
Moslem pilgrims.</p>

<p>The day dreaded by the Jews passed without incident,
but in the light of what took place a couple of days later,
I am inclined to think that this desirable result was
achieved, not so much by the precautions taken by the
Administration, as by those taken by the Jewish Self-Defence
Corps, which was known to be held in readiness
for all eventualities on that day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 4th April, a belated crowd of pilgrims
from Hebron approached the Holy City by the Jaffa
Gate. Fanatical agitators posted themselves on the
balcony of the Municipality Building and, for the space
of two hours, delivered brutally inflammatory speeches
against the Jews to this mob, in the presence of British
officials who understood Arabic. It must be remembered
that these pilgrims were armed, and yet no
attempt was made to suppress the agitators, although
there was ample police and military strength available
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Immediately after the inflammatory speeches, acts of
violence began.</p>

<p>I reproduce here extracts from a couple of letters which
I received, giving graphic descriptions of the outbreak
by eye-witnesses, one of them a Senior British Officer,
not a Jew:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>We are passing through terrible and unprecedented
times. Who could ever have thought that
a pogrom "à la Russe," with all its horrors, could
take place in Jerusalem under British rule! Who
could ever have conceived that it should be possible,
in the Holy City of Jerusalem, that for three days
Jews, old and young, women and children could
be slaughtered; that rape should be perpetrated,
Synagogues burnt, scrolls of the Law defiled, and
property plundered right and left, under the banner
of England!</p>

<p>The anti-Jewish feeling of the Administration
here you, of course, know all about, as you have
experienced it yourself, but latterly the notorious
<i>Syria Genuba</i> (an Arab daily in Jerusalem)
printed day after day inflammatory articles against
the Jews....</p>

<p>Anti-Jewish demonstrations were allowed to take
place and inflammatory speeches were allowed to
be made against the Jews. The evil men amongst
the Arabs openly declared that they would
slaughter the Jews at the Festival of Nebi Musa.
The Government was warned by the Jewish press,
and by Jewish responsible leaders, but these were
not listened to, and, as a matter of fact, the Feast
was proclaimed with great pomp, Lord Allenby
and Major-General Louis Jean Bols, the Chief
Administrator, being present....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Colonel</span>,</p>

<p>... with my wife I went up to Jerusalem to
spend the Easter week-end, and a very nice week-end
it surely was! Long before this letter reaches
you, you will have learned something of the happenings
in the Holy City, but as my wife and I saw
the first blow struck, and had very personal experience
of the immediately ensuing bother, you
may be interested.</p>

<p>The happenings here have raised all sorts of
questions, and while for the moment the trouble is
over, I fear the end is not yet.</p>

<p>On the morning of Easter Sunday we were
standing on the balcony of the New Grand Hotel
watching the progress of an Arab procession just
arrived from Hebron. As the procession reached
the entrance to the Jaffa Gate it just had the
appearance of the usual show of this kind&mdash;a bit
noisy, but apparently well-behaved. It was
escorted by two officers of the Military Administration
and a few of the Arab police. All at once the
members of the procession formed themselves into
a square, just inside the gate, and the first thing
we saw then was an old Jew, about 70 years of age,
get his head split open with an Arab's sword, and
as soon as he was down he was stoned; within a
few minutes a lot more Jews got like treatment.
By this time the crowd was well out of hand and
rushed quickly into the old City looting and killing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and a few hours afterwards there was a steady
evacuation of battered Jews. There was no
military present.</p>

<p>The following day the trouble started again, and
a lot more were injured, and the third morning
there was more looting and more casualties, and
then at last the military took strong steps and the
trouble was at an end.</p>

<p>....</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In less than half an hour from the beginning of the
outbreak, two companies of the Self-Defence Corps
marched to the Jaffa and Damascus Gates to assist in
quelling the disturbance within the walls, but they found
the gates closed to them and held by British troops. It
is very significant that within a few minutes of the commencement
of the pogrom, British troops held all the
gates of the city, with explicit orders to allow no one in
and <i>no one out</i>&mdash;not even helpless women, fleeing from
the horrors that were being enacted in the Jewish
quarter, unless they held special permits.</p>

<p>For nearly three days the work of murder, rape,
sacrilege, and pillage went on practically unchecked&mdash;all
under British rule. There is only one word which
fittingly describes the situation, and that is the Russian
word "pogrom." It means a semi-lawful attack on
Jews. The assailants believe that they may murder,
rape, burn and loot to their hearts' content, with the
silent blessing of the authorities, and it is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
significant fact that all through this Jerusalem
pogrom the hooligans' cry was "<i>El dowleh ma ana,</i>"
which means "<i>The Government is with us.</i>" The
attackers were absolutely convinced of the truth of their
battle cry.</p>

<p>During these three terrible days several Jews were
killed, hundreds were wounded (many of these being old
men, women and children), rape was perpetrated,
Synagogues were burnt, and tens of thousands of
pounds worth of Jewish property was looted or
destroyed.</p>

<p>The pogrom was confined to that part of Jerusalem
within the walls of the old City, where the Moslems
greatly outnumber the Jews&mdash;in fact the latter are here
a small and helpless minority. They take no part in
politics, not even in political Zionism, but are absorbed
in religious practices and observances, and abhor all
things worldly. Even self-defence is repellent to them,
and all forms of violence anathema.</p>

<p>These harmless people dwell in half-a-dozen narrow
tortuous streets and bazaars, in one corner of the old
City. This Jewish quarter is quite easy to defend. A
few armed men posted at the narrow entrances could
hold any mob at bay. Why did not the military authorities
see that this was done? It was not until the third
day that effective action was taken. In the meantime,
hell was let loose on these unfortunate people. Even
the wretched few who got to the City gates, unless they
possessed special permits, were refused permission to
escape and were forced to return to the devilries being
enacted by the murdering, raping, looting mob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a black page in our history, and those responsible
should not be allowed to escape just punishment.</p>

<p>To cover their own blunders the local Administration
looked round for a scapegoat, and arrested Jabotinsky
and some score members of the Jewish Self-Defence
Corps.</p>

<p>Jabotinsky was tried on a ridiculous charge of
"banditism, instigating the people of the Ottoman
Empire to mutual hatred, pillage, rapine, devastation of
the country, and homicide in divers places"&mdash;in fact
the Ottoman penal code was ransacked to trump up
these absurd charges against him. Jabotinsky had been
guilty of nothing except that he had organised the Self-Defence
Corps with the full knowledge of the authorities,
many weeks before the outbreak, and it was owing to the
existence of this Corps that the pogrom did not take
much more serious dimensions. By far the greater
part of the Jews, and practically all the Zionist Jews,
dwell outside the old City in the modern part of
Jerusalem, and it would naturally be upon these that
the mob would have fallen, but not a Jewish house
outside the City walls was raided, for the simple
reason that the Jewish Self-Defence Corps was there
and ready to act.</p>

<p>The Self-Defence Corps did nothing whatever
against the British Authorities, and many members of it
were in fact used by the Administration to police the
environs of the City. Nevertheless, a British Military
Court, which publicly stated that it would be bound by
no rules of procedure, was found, which convicted
Jabotinsky, and inflicted upon him the savagely vindictive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
sentence of FIFTEEN YEARS' PENAL
SERVITUDE!</p>

<p>This trumping up of the preposterous charges mentioned
is a disgrace to British Justice, and the whole
history of this atrocious outrage is a foul stain on our
fair fame.</p>

<p>It may be noted in passing that two Arabs caught
raping Jewish girls during the pogrom received the same
sentence as Jabotinsky, whose only crime was that he
was a Jew.</p>

<p>Jabotinsky was cast into prison, clothed in prison garb,
had his hair cropped, and was marched in company with
the two Arabs convicted of rape through Jerusalem and
Kantara, places where he was well known as a British
officer. Even the worst Hun that we have read of could
hardly have exceeded the savagery and tyranny shown
by the Military Authorities of the E.E.F. towards
Jabotinsky, an officer who fought stoutly for us and
helped England and her cause in every possible way to
the full extent of his power during the War.</p>

<p>Of course a storm of public indignation was aroused.
In fact one of our leading Statesmen, on seeing the
telegram announcing the barbarous sentence, was heard
to remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Military in Palestine must have gone mad."</p>

<p>The matter was raised in the House of Commons, and
Mr. Churchill, who was then Secretary of State for
War, was called upon to make a statement. The War
Office took action and, in a very short time, the sentence
was annulled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>It apparently required this outrage to open the eyes
of the Home Government to what was going on in
Palestine. As soon as they realised the situation,
matters began to move in the right direction, and one of
the first steps taken was the removal of the Military
Administration which had failed so hopelessly to carry
out the policy of the Imperial Government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The Dawn.</span></div>


<p>While Jerusalem was yet plunged in sorrow and
filled with lamentation, the glad tidings arrived
from San Remo that the Allied Council had endorsed
England's promise of a National Home for the Jews in
Palestine, and that Great Britain had been appointed
the Mandatory Power.</p>

<p>England, to emphasize her determination to deal
justly with Israel, wisely decided that the ruler of Palestine
should be a Jew, and appointed Sir Herbert Samuel
as first High Commissioner of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>When the great roll-call is made of those who have
helped in bringing about the Restoration, the name of
Baron Edmund de Rothschild will take a high and
honourable place. His boundless munificence to the
Zionist cause and to the Zionist Colonists in Palestine
has helped the movement enormously.</p>

<p>Palestine will loom larger and larger in world importance
as the years roll by. We have seen that it is the
very keystone of our policy in the Near and Far East,
and when it is colonized by a friendly people working
hand in hand with England then the vexed question of
our interests in those regions will be solved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>There is plenty of room in Palestine for both Jew and
Arab, and, in fact, one is the complement of the other.
At present there are about 650,000 Arabs in the country,
but when Palestine is watered and tilled and made a
fruitful country once again, it will support a population of
five or six millions of people.</p>

<p>Not only would the Jews not injure the Arabs, but,
on the contrary, Jewish colonization and Jewish enterprise
will prove extremely beneficial to all the dwellers
in Palestine.</p>

<p>The Jewish immigrants now going into the country
are full of boundless enthusiasm, ready to work and give
even life itself to bring about the reconstruction of their
ancient Homeland.</p>

<p>With Jewish brains, Jewish labour, and Jewish
capital, Palestine will be made to flourish like the proverbial
green bay tree. The land will be irrigated and
afforested; water power will be "harnessed" and made
to supply light and heat. Trade of all sorts will spring
up, fresh markets for goods will be opened, the wonderful
natural harbour of Haifa will be improved&mdash;and all
of this will naturally bring increased wealth and comfort
to the Arab as well as to the Jew.</p>

<p>Even at the present moment the Jewish colonies are a
joy to behold, and the land in their immediate neighbourhood
has gone up in value threefold.</p>

<p>For many years the Jew and the Arab have worked
together without the slightest friction, and I see no
reason for any in the future. There will be no trouble
whatever in Palestine between these two peoples
when the country is properly governed, and the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
officials loyally carry out the policy of the Imperial
Government.</p>

<p>With an efficient straightforward Administration,
holding the scales of Justice evenly, and working in co-operation
with Jew and Arab, the dawn of a new and
prosperous era for the Holy Land is assured, and Israel's
age-long aspirations will at last be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Britain's share towards the fulfilment of prophecy
must, however, not be forgotten, and the names of Mr.
Lloyd George and Sir Arthur Balfour, two men who
were raised up to deal justly with Israel, will, I feel sure,
live for all time in the hearts and affections of the Jewish
people. It is owing to the stimulus given by the Balfour
Declaration to the soul of Jewry throughout the world
that we are now looking upon the wonderful spectacle
unfolding itself before our eyes, of the people of Israel
returning to the Land promised to Abraham and his seed
for ever.</p>

<p>In the ages to come it will always redound to the glory
of England that it was through her instrumentality that
the Jewish people were enabled to return and establish
their National Home in the Promised Land.</p>

<p>"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in
the morning."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

<h2>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***<br />

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email
contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  <a

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
